         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough God was what he is, and in the perfect fruition of his <hi>Grandeurs,</hi> before his omnipotent hand had drawn the Creatures out of their Nothing;
<note place="margin">The motives which invited God to create the world.</note> yet his Nature required Hommages, his Majeſty Servitudes, his Glory Admirations, his Goodneſs Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments, and his Beauty hearts and affections. It was needfull, though he were independent of all Beings, Immenſe in his extent, Eternall in his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and Infinite in all his perfections, that he ſhould cauſe himſelf to be ſeen and felt by Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations out of himſelf. It was not ſufficient, (me thinks) that God ſhould contemplate himſelf in the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:157758:7"/>Myrror of his Eſſence, and that without iſſuing out of himſelf he ſhould beget his <hi>Word</hi> in the ſplendors which flow from his Claritie. It was not enough to love himſelf, and in loving himſelf to produce with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out change, loſs, or alteration the ſacred fire of his Love. All theſe immanent and infinite productions could not exhauſt the Treaſures of ſo fruitfull a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: For in giving it ſelf, it ſuffers no detriment, ſince amidſt theſe ſallies and Emanations the Father and the Son in ſuch ſort communicate their Nature and perfections, the Father, to the Son, and both to the Holy Ghoſt, that all three by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon power can act <hi>ad extra</hi> or exteriorly, and they needed to employ but one ſingle word to create not only a World, but even Worlds without end.</p>
               <p>I repreſent unto my ſelf that Nature ſigh'd even without tongue or voice,
<note place="margin">The ſighs of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> before ſhe had a being: Me thinks I hear her ſilence, and that ſhe ſaith to God before her Creation;</p>
               <p>Speak then, O ſpeak (Great God) ſtretch forth thy arm and caſt thy looks out of thy ſelf; iſſue forth of the Luminous Darkneſs, which formes thee a day without Night, and a Night more reſplendent then the day. Give ſome little paſſage to thoſe Eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations and flames which from all eternity are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed within thy boſome, and which frame therein a Circle of Light and Love. Thou needſt but open thy mouth and immediatly all Creatures will be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to thy commands: The leaſt of thy Irradia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will diſſipate the ſhadows, and open that abyſs, in which they are buried. It is true that nothing ought to diſturbe the peace and repoſe of thy ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; It is true thou haſt and poſſeſſeſt in thy ſelf all that can ever be. But thou canſt bring it to light, and art able without noyſe and diſorder to break that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ſilence which hitherto hath made thee heard
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:157758:7"/>but of thy ſelf. In fine thou art a God of Love, and this love would be Captive, if it had not Sallies, and Ejaculations. It was not ſatisfied to remain in thee by eminence, and as it were in the ſource of beauty and goodneſs; but having made its folds within its ſelf by numberleſs revolutions,

This wiſe and all-knowing Workman to whom all things are poſſible, drew out of Durt, Morter, and Duſt, the Bones which were to be not only the Pyles, Pillars, Baſis and ſtrength of the Body, but even the inſtruments of all its Motions. He added to it Ligaments, Joynts, Carthelages, Nerves, and an infinity of fibres or little ſtrings which were to lock the Bones and Members within one an other, to be ſerviceable to all motions, to arm every part, to keep in or draw ſuperfluous humors, or rather to be aſſiſting to its Nouriſhment. The Body being thus rough-drawn, or as I may ſay, in its firſt draught, appeared at the ſame inſtant divided into three parts, of which the higheſt and moſt elevated was the Head, the Bulk appeared in the midſt, and the Joynts linked together the Legs, and Arms, to become more uſefull to all the extreme parts.
<note place="margin">The Oeconomy of humane bodies.</note> With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe joynts were, as inchaſed, all the Inſtruments of life. Within the Trunk reigned the Vitall parts, as the Heart, Lungs, and Liver; about which were found a thouſand little Veins, and as many little skins, which are the Chanels of the Bloud and of all the Humours. O ſtrange! this little Labyrinth was no ways confus'd. The Heart, though Monarch and Soveraign in this Empire, diſdains not to unite its ſelf with the Liver, and to joyn by a mutuall and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:157758:12"/>reciprocall agreement its vertue and heat to act with more force upon the Aliment. From thence iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues a world of interlaced Veins, which are to ſuck in the pureſt of the <hi>Chilus,</hi> and to diſcharge the groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer part, which afterwards conveys it all at leaſure into the Bowels; At the ſame time the Liver will ſeparate the Bloud, and divide the Humours; and whilſt the Heart is diſtributing all the Spirits through the Arteries, leſt it chance to be over-heated, the more light, humid, and ſpungeous Lungs will give it air, and refreſh it by ſo regular intervals, as even amids this palpitation, it may receive from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries its pureſt Bloud, and its moſt delicious Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment. All the reſt paſſeth into the Brain which is the Summet of this admirable Structure. It is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered outwardly with skin and hair, and wrapped up within two panicles which cover its out-lets, its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and the ſource of all the Nerves. It is in this Fort or Dungeon where the Animall ſpirits are to be formed, which the Senſitive ſoul diſtributes to the Five ſenſes; ſpirits which are but fire and ray, which very often get looſe, and eſcape by the eyes like light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and ſo many ſtars which appear to us at high Noon.</p>
               <p>There is the ſeat of the Common ſenſe, where all the Nerves of our exterior Senſes meet, through which the Spirits ſlide, and is the way by which the Species paſs when they are the Meſſengers of their Objects. Well may this part receive theſe Images, but cannot retain them. The Imagination then muſt be placed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther within, which collecting &amp; preſerving the Species, will borrow part of their name. Behold the Body thus perfect, and accompliſhed; but not to deſcry all the bones naked, and a fleſh too lively and bloody, cover it with the whiteſt, ſmootheſt and thinneſt skin you can find. Afterwards fix your eys upon his Face, behold his
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:157758:13"/>lovely Hair ſweetly floating on his ſhoulders; contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate his Forehead ſmoother than Marble, &amp; his Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brows forming an Arch of Ebony over his eyes; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider his Mouth ſurrounded with Corall; obſerve his Cheeks mixed with Roſes, and Lillyes, and ſmell his Breath a thouſand times ſweeter than Amber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greece. In truth are you not raviſhed with the aſpect of his Eyes, which are the Windows of the Soul, the Doors of Life, and the moſt faithfull Interpreters of our Minds? What ſay you to the diſcloſure of this living Theater of Choler,

But who will wonder at this, ſince in truth theſe are the two Suns of the Little World, and the Myrror of the Great one, which is to be compriſed and incloſed within the Humane Body.</p>

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:157758:18"/>their Fathers and Mothers certain Horrors, which make them fly at the leaſt noat of the birds of Night? Whence comes it, that the skins of Sheep, though dead, break in peeces at the approach of the skins of Wolves? and that Lambs, ſcarce come out of the Yeows belly, have nevertheleſſe natural apprehenſions of the Wolf?</p>
               <p>My ſoul! haſt thou not ſeen Chickens hiding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the wings of a Hen at the meer ſhadow of a Kite?

If thou telleſt me they are Natural, and have bin as it were infuſed by Nature, even from the firſt to the laſt of each kind; I likewiſe anſwer, that this Original ſtain of culpable Nature is derived from father to ſon, and from the firſt man to all his of-ſpring, and ſo it comes to be imprinted in the ſubſtance of their Souls.</p>
               <p>And if thou haſt a deſire to paſſe further, and know the reaſon, I am content: ſtand then upon thy guard, my Soul; for I intend to fight thee with thy own Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons.

Is it not as true, that when thou armeſt thy Hands to commit a Murther, and thy Tongue to detract and bite like a Dog, or to vomit forth ſome Blaſphemy, it is thou that makeſt both thy Hand and Tongue culpable; which are thy Members, thy Officers, thy Slaves, and Executioners, which act, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and execute what thou haſt commanded them?</p>

From whence I conclude, that as Actuall ſins committed by the Ears, Eyes, and Hands, take their Malignity from the Heart, and Will, which is their Cauſe, and Origin; ſo likewiſe thoſe ſins, which are commonly called Originall,
<note place="margin">The firſt Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> and are found in the Soul of all Mankind, have as it were crept in, and taken their Deſcent from <hi>Adam,</hi> as their Author and beginner, which having been once infected, hath after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward made its venom paſs from Father to Son as by Hereditary right.</p>

It is you Fathers and Mothers, who in your Houſes ought to be Judges of all the differences, which ariſe between your Sons and Daughters, and firſt of all you ought to know the naturall diſpoſition of your Children, to the end that if ſome <hi>Cain</hi> be found amongſt them you may timely ſuppreſs him.

               <p>And it is far more gentle, that you your ſelves upon the firſt Symptoms of Evill, ſhould take the pains to apply a Coſtick to them, or give them a ſtroak with your Lancet, than after too much remiſneſs to ſee them take a ſharp Razer cutting in pieces the Heart and all the Members of your other Children.

<note place="margin">Plato in pluribus lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis.</note> for I hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore took pleaſure to remark in his moſt charming, and true <hi>Idea</hi>'s, that Man was in this Life, as in an Army,

               </p>
               <p>Follow me then,

               <p>Well then <hi>Abraham,</hi> get thee out of thine own Countrey, leave all thy Friends, and break thoſe many tyes, which Blood hath woven in thy Veins and Heart. The Milk thou haſt ſuck'd is from henceforth no other than poyſon, the Nouriſhment thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from thy Parents doth but ſuſtain thy Body, and ſtifle thy Soul: In fine the Light and Brightneſs of Heaven cannot be ſeen amidſt the Shades and Smoak of thy Country.</p>
               <p>But what! muſt poor <hi>Abraham</hi> leave himſelf? O my God! why doſt thou oblige him to forſake his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved <hi>Chaldea,</hi> and why wouldſt thou have him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate himſelf from his Kindred and Friends? He is in a flouriſhing City, and thou perchance wilt lead him into ſome ſolitary place or deſart.

He wants nothing at Home, and it may come to paſs, that every thing will fayl him amongſt Strangers.</p>
               <p>Theſe motives are too weak to break the Deſires, and Deſigns of a Soul which God courteth. <hi>It is a
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:157758:33"/>delicious thing to leave the ſtreams for their ſource, and to forſake our ſelves to give our ſelves unto our Maker.</hi> The World and <hi>Chaldea</hi> are but a poynt in compariſon of the Firmament, and all the Elements in reſpect of the Impy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall Heavens, are but a heap of vapours, and a Globe of exhalations. To this I adde, that the moſt peopled Cities, and Provinces, are frightfull Dens, liveleſs Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and moſt ſolitary Deſarts, if God be not there; and on the contrary, the moſt dreadfull Solitudes, and leaſt inhabited Grots become Courts and Palaces, as ſoon as God and his Spirit reſide therein. Finally all Repoſes are Diſquiet, all Peace is but War, all Honours are Contempts, Parents are Traitors, Brothers Envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Friends Deceivers, Houſes and Beds Sepulchers, and Life is but a Death, or at beſt, but a long, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous ſickneſs, unleſs God be the Loadſtone of our Hearts, the higheſt pitch of our Glory, and the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of all our affections: for he ſhall then be our Father, our Brother, and our Friend, and in his boſome we ſhall find our Countrey, Parents, pleaſures and delights without bitterneſs, and without any mixture of thoſe paſſions, which are ſtill arm'd to beſiege our Hearts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> underſtood all theſe verities from the very morning of his vocation; and at the firſt overture of the favours which God imparted to him, he took a Staff in his Hand, and became a Pilgrim in the World, ſufficiently diſcovering, that the life of Man is but a Pilgrimage, and that a Man ſhall firſt, or laſt, reach the Port. It was nevertheleſs hard for him, as I believe, to take his Wife for a Companion in his voyages, to adopt his Nephew for his Son, and to bring away all his Goods, and Baggage, before his Kindred could have notice of it. Then God knowes what Noiſe, what Tumult, what Aſtoniſhment in the whole Family, and amongſt his Allyes: God knowes whether Friends appear'd troubleſome, and whether the moſt indifferent ſtrove in this caſe to expreſſe their paſſion. Let every
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:157758:34"/>one repreſent unto himſelf what may befall him, and what is wont to ſurpriſe all thoſe that depart out their Country, and are oblig'd to forſake their Friends; They imagin that even Iron, ſtones, trees, and beaſts, look upon them with the Eyes of Compaſſion, and that what ever hath leaſt of animation aſſumes Voices, and Tongues to teſtify their regret, and bid them adieu. A poor Soul hath then very ſenſible convulſions, and amidſt ſo violent, and ſweet aſſaults, it is almoſt impoſſible to remain a Conquerour.</p>
               <p>It is in vain to advertiſe him, that it is God who ſpeaks unto him, that it is an Inſpiration from Heaven which preſſeth him, and that they are the Graces of Paradiſe which will triumph over Nature, and Hell.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding theſe thoughts, and inſpirations, the Sun doth not riſe, but to preſent unto him a thouſand Portraictures of thoſe whom he hath left behind. The Moon, and Starrs, ſhew him by Night, and in ſleep, nothing but the Images of thoſe whom he hath aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and he awakes a Thouſand times with ſighes from his Heart, and teares in his Eyes, to imbrace the Shadows, and Phantaſmes of his deareſt Friends. This is that at laſt which makes him often renounce his good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and take truthes for Illuſious, and Darkneſs for rayes of light. Alas what Shame, and Cowardiſe! This poor man is not gone a Musket-ſhot from the City, and ſcarce hath loſt the ſight of his ſteeple, but he preſently reaſſumes his former wayes, and returns with an intent to build his Tower, or rather his Tomb, on his Chimney's Harth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> was far more couragious, and the rayes which God darted into his heart made not onely more lively, but more conſtant Impreſſions therein. For immediatly he begins his journey, he goes on without prefixing any Limit to himſelf, he obeyes a ſingle voice, and followes a guide, who having once ſpoken, diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares.</p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:157758:34"/>

               <p>Is not this a ſtrange reſolution, and will not theſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſities be thought too blind in a worldly mind? No truely, theſe thoughts will never fall into a Soul, which knows the force and power of a vocation wholy divine, ſuch as was that of this incomparable Man,

               <p>Well then, is not this to love peace, and to purchaſe at his own expence ſo pretious a treaſure? Is not this to be magnificent, and can any one ſeek an accord with more Prodigality?

There are nevertheleſs faint-hearted Men and Effeminate Spirits, to whom the name of Peace is not venerable, by reaſon the bare noiſe of the juſteſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats uſeth to put them into a Feaver. They are like that Coward of <hi>Athens,</hi> who dy'd hearing a Trumpet, which was ſounded at the beginning of an aſſault, or rather that heartleſs <hi>Sybarite,</hi> who ſeeing a Dart but
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:157758:40"/>in Picture made a vow never to uſe a Sword, or Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, never to come into the Field, were it but to mow Graſs.</p>
               <p>This is not to have a pacifique Spirit,
<note place="margin">A ſhamefull Puſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanimity.</note> and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions unto Meekneſs, and Peace, but rather to bear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a humane Body the Soul of a tender Chick; or at leaſt ſuch people reſemble thoſe Indians, who trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the ſight of their own ſhadows, and from whom, if one ſhould take away their Hands when they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to Eat or Drink, one would judge them to be Statues and feather'd ſpecters, which tremble at the leaſt breath of Air.</p>
               <p>There is then an other Spirit of Peace, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in Tranquillity, and knows not what it is to ſeek occaſions of War, and pretences of diſſention; But where once Right, Piety, Alliances, or violated Juſtice put Arms into their Hands, at the ſame inſtant this vapor which was hidden in the Clouds, and framed Veils againſt the violences of the Sun, begins to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert it ſelf into a Maſs of flaming Coals, which ſet fire on the Heavens, and puts the Earth into a dreadfull fright.</p>
               <p>Behold here the Image of a generous courage of a pacifique Soul, and of a moſt valorons Heart; every where it ſetleth Peace, every where it accordeth dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, and never refuſeth any Treaty of Union: But where it is provok'd, and that there is need of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving its own Rights, or revenging the injury done unto Allies, you inſtantly ſee it in the Head of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: It orders Troups; It is in the fight, at the charge, at the ſpoyl, at the chaſe, and in action; briefly it is all Heart, and its Body ſeems to be chang'd into Arms, and Hands, to defend its Life, its Right and Honor.</p>
               <p>But who would have believed, that <hi>Abrahams</hi> hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and courage, had been of this temper, when he was only ſeen to take <hi>Lot</hi> by the Hand, and ſay unto him, that all his goods belonged unto him, and that to

               <p>A Midſt all theſe ſucceſſes and congratulations <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> who had ſetled Peace in <hi>Judea</hi> and in the Neighbouring Territories, felt his Heart to have ſome deſire of making War againſt him, and, as if fear and diſtruſt had been willing to baniſh Faith from his Soul, he began already to complain, or at leaſt to preſent ſome requeſt unto God, ſaying,</p>
               <p>Ah my Lord! where is this ſo flouriſhing Progeny? where is this ſo numerous poſterity? and where are theſe Children thou haſt promiſed me? Can it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly happen, that a Stranger and a Servant ſhould be the ſupport of my Houſe, and the Inheritor of all my For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes? I ſee my ſelf encompaſſed with Enemies: I feel my ſelf burthened with old age, and there is as it were no longer any probability I ſhould ever hope for Children.</p>
               <p>I very much doubt whether <hi>Abraham</hi> had ever an intention to complain. However he was ſomewhat afraid, and God to deliver him out of his fear ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him in moſt expreſs terms, <hi>Abraham</hi> fear nothing,

                  </note> for I have promiſed to keep thee alwaies in my prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and to be for ever the recompence of thy Faith and hopes.</p>
               <p>But yet Lord! ſaith <hi>Abraham,</hi> what is that thou wilt give me? for a long time, is already ſpun out ſince I have been in expectation, and I have not the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of any other Goods, than thoſe I could hope for from your bounty. Certainly the Privacies of a Holy Soul are in high eſteem with God; was there ever any thing more free, more open, and <hi>Genuine,</hi> than the Heart of <hi>Abraham?</hi> What Favourite of the Kings of

Adding to him afterwards, that ſuddainly he ſhould have a Son by his dear <hi>Sara,</hi> who ſhould be the Heir of his poſſeſſions, and the ornament of his Family.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all theſe Aſſurances and promiſes <hi>Sara</hi> who felt her ſelf Barren permitted her Husband what the Law and Cuſtom of that time allowed; And much more, for this Chaſt Wife humbly intreated, that <hi>Agar</hi> though a Servant, might ſhare with her in his Bed and affections; but as it commonly happens that Honours trample on the Right and Duties of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Agar</hi> was no ſooner become a Mother, but ſhe would be at the ſame time alſo a Miſtreſs.</p>
               <p>It is a very ſtrange ſpectacle to behold the inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Fortune. <hi>There is nothing ſo inſupportable as a proud poor Man, as a Servant who is become Maſter, and, as a beggarly Woman who hath the Keys of a good Houſe.</hi> Theſe Monſters of Mankind reſemble thoſe Exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<note place="margin">Humane Monſters.</note> which after they are raiſed from the Dunghils of the Earth, take the ſhape of the Sun, or of a Comet, whoſe aſpect is terrible and dreadfull to all beholders. They are alſo like thoſe little Streams about four or five Feet in breath, which run Serpentizing about Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and ſometimes commit ſo many ſpoils in one hour as the Sea would not doe in a hundred years.</p>
               <p>But as the Sun with two or three Days of heat drys up theſe Torrents; ſo God in the twinkling of an Eye
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:157758:42"/>humbleth the Pride of all the inſolent, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo deteſtable in his ſight as a Proud Man, who was Born in Miſery and Poverty, unleſs thoſe blind furies chance to relent either through due conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ſome croſs fortune, which invites God to reſume his Eyes of Compaſſion to behold their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſter.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Agar</hi> having been diſgracefully driven out of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s and <hi>Sara</hi>'s Houſe, when her wandring heart had leaſure to entertain more humble and mild thoughts; God who hath fatherly tenderneſſes for thoſe who place their whole ſtrength and Conſolation in Meekneſſe and Humility, immediatly ſent an Angel to her, who promiſed her a favorable return; and beſides, gave her aſſurances that ſhortly ſhe ſhould have a Son, who ſhould be called <hi>Jſmael:</hi> in effect, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and was delivered, as the Angel had ſaid, <hi>Abraham</hi> being no leſſe than fourſcore and ſix years old or neer upon.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>The Continuation of the favours which God conferred on</hi> Abraham.</head>
               <p>THE Love which God bears to all Creatures is a rare Artiſt, it is alwayes active,
<note place="margin">Love never idle</note> alwayes ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and never ſeen idle; It is a fire which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſeeking new aliment; It is a torrent which never ſtops; it is a lightning which cannot long remain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed within a Cloud, &amp; a Planet which knows not what repoſe or retirement meaneth. Painters for this reaſon gave it winges, and in pictures it is for the moſt part ever ſeen with one foot in the air.</p>
               <p>Wee muſt not then wonder, if the heart of <hi>Abraham</hi> being repleniſhed with this Love, God commanded him to March, and ſtill to advance.</p>

               <p>It imports not (ſaith God unto him) it is I that ſpeak,

               <p>Alas! if all Men had this leſſon deeply ingraven in their Souls, and if all ſuch as make Profeſſion of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing God were reſolved never to make a ſtop upon the Earth, untill they were arrived at the propoſed end; What Progreſs would be ſeen in Vertues, what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances in the way of Paradiſe, and of Glory? More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, if we had often this thought, that Gods Eyes are fixed on all the Motions of the Body and Soul, ſhould we find ſo many Cowardly, Idle, and Lazy Perſons ſtanding with their Arms acroſs, and whoſe Reaſon is buryed in a ſhamefull Brutality?</p>
               <p>Is it vain then God Commands us to goe alwaies aſcending,

               <p>It is likewiſe with him he makes an attonement, and it is in his Perſon he eſtabliſheth the King of Men, and the Father of all believers. Moreover as it is the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom to impoſe on things a name Conformable to their Nature, and as it appertains only to the Elect, and ſuch as are predſtinated, to have Names which muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred in the Book of Life, and which neither times nor ſeaſons will ever efface; ſo God changed his name,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:157758:43"/>which till then was <hi>Abram,</hi> adding to it one Divine Letter, and one of thoſe Sacred Ciphers of which Men uſe to expreſs the ineffable Name of God, a very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Sign that he was one day to take (as the Apoſtle ſaith) his Origin and temporall Birth from <hi>Abraham.</hi>

               <p>This is the opinion of Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> St. <hi>Chyſoſtom,</hi> and <hi>Theodoret;</hi> who adde, that the Circumciſion of the Jews was but a Corporall Figure of that Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion which ſhould be in the Spirit of Grace, and in the bleſſed Law of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> who deſires not a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:157758:44"/>of Bloud and rigour, but of Love, whoſe ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and holy tyranny is ſometimes more violent over the Soul, than the Law of the Jews hath ever been over the Body.</p>
               <p>Moreover Circumciſion was not only a Figure of Baptiſm,
<note place="margin">of cumciſion ſign Peace.</note> but a Conſtant and infallible Mark of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement God had made with <hi>Abraham:</hi> Now this ordinary denotation of Love, and this ſacred Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Peace was to be imprinted on the Body of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that the remembrance of the favours God had ſhewed them might increaſe their duties of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, Piety, and Faith towards God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly this effuſion of Blood was a lively repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and animated by the Faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed the Voice of one God, who preſently caſt Veils over his Eyes, infuſed Light into his Mind, and Fires into his Heart, which made him abandon all Creatures to remain under the ſole Protection of Heaven.</p>
               <p>In the fourth place this Phlebotomy ſerved to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the Jews from other Nations; ſo that as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore the Grecians eſteemed all the People of the World barbarous and brutall; ſo the Jews had a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom to call all thoſe Uncircumciſed, who would not ſubject themſelves to Circumciſion.</p>
               <p>In fine, this rigour, and this Bloodie precept God impoſed on the <hi>Hebrews</hi> was an effect of the firſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after which deſerved tears and cicatrices of Bloud. This was the Remedy which Men had to heal this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall wound which remains ſtill bleeding.</p>
               <p>Now there needed ſuch a healing hand, as that of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to receive this Bloudy but efficacious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, which was to mollifie not only the Obduration of the Jews, but had alſo a ſecret vertue to wipe away the ſtains of that mortall Poyſon, which the Serpent of Paradiſe, or rather of Hell, had vomited into all Hearts. This was then a particular favour of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Abraham,</hi> but it was not the laſt; for he gave him

               <p>In truth theſe thoughts and a thouſand ſuch as uſe to happen upon a like accident, are too deeply ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in Nature and in our Hearts to appear barely on the Lips, and upon Paper.

               <p>
                  <hi>Abraham, Abraham,</hi> can it poſſibly be that this ſo ſweet ſo amiable, and ſo Holy a Name muſt ſerve to ſummon thee to an office which appears ſo cruell, and unnaturall, as the Murther of thy Son? Is it perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to carry thee more promptly to the execution of this ſad decree that thou art twice called? Art thou deaf to the firſt words of thy God? or doſt thou not perform readily enough what God commandeth? Art thou ſo fixed on thy <hi>Iſaack</hi> that thou no longer thinkeſt on God? what is the matter? Art thou ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified and haſt neither Heart nor care for thy Maſter?</p>
               <p>Lord behold me here, ſaith <hi>Abraham,</hi> what is thy will? and where, and in what, may I manifeſt my Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Love?</p>
               <p>There are many who have complements enough in their Mouths,
<note place="margin">Fruitleſs Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> and offer, themſelves freely enough, but if a Man muſt ingage either life, goods, honor, or the leaſt of his intereſts, he inſtantly retires, and his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt friends remain without offers and effects.</p>
               <p>Let us examin whether <hi>Abrahams.</hi> Heart be of the ſame temper of thoſe faint friends? God calls him, and he returns anſwers unto God? God calls him again, and he proteſts that he is ready to execute all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: much more; for this Holy Man never contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted the leaſt injunction God had laid on him; he left his Country, he forſook his Parents, and his life was but a voyage of Obedience, and an exile of Love. What can God deſire more of him?</p>
               <p>This is yet not all God requires of him, and the trials, though too long and too harſh, God hitherto made of his fidelity, were but the Prologues of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat which muſt be far more rigorous. Love is content
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:157758:55"/>to put a ſtaff in his Hand to walk him through the World, but he immediatly preſents him with a Sword to undertake a dreadfull Duel, though it be a Duel of Love.</p>

               <p>Without doubt, this would be the diſcourſe of a Father, whoſe Soul ſhould be agitated with various paſſions, and the moſt part of theſe reſentments are more proper for a Man whoſe Eyes Nature, Bloud, the World, and Infidelity had ſnut againſt the pureſt lights of Heaven, than for <hi>Abraham</hi> who never fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed other Torch than that of Divine Providence.

He was ready to immolate <hi>Iſaack,</hi> and the Love he had for his God made him wiſh to himſelf a Deſtiny like that of his Son. This Man, ſaith <hi>Origen,</hi> was not aſtoniſhed at the voice of ſo harſh a
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:157758:57"/>Command, he refuſed nothing, and took Counſell of no living Soul, reſting content to obey his God.</p>
               <p>This Juſt Patriarch, ſaith St. <hi>Zenon,</hi> preferred the Love of the Creator before that of the Creature.

               <p>But O God of goodneſs! remember that <hi>Abraham</hi> is a Man, that he is a Father, that he hath but One Son, and that he Loves nothing in compariſon of this Son; place not all theſe objects of Pitty before his Eyes, reſt ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed in Sacrificing the Son without cauſing the death of the Father; lay ſome cover over the Fore head of the Prieſt, and over the Eyes of the Victime: And doe not ſolicite the tenderneſſe of either, and ſpeak neither of <hi>Abraham</hi> nor <hi>Jſaack,</hi> nor of the Father or Son; but pronounce the decree in moſt rigorous termes, and call no more upon the name of Sweetneſſe and Love, for that were to ſolicite his diſobedience.</p>

               <p>But is it not better for him to be accounted a good Father, than a good Servant? And will not <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> Diſobedience be rather excuſed than the Murther of his Son? <hi>Abraham</hi> believed otherwiſe, and the choice he made was to loſe the quality of a Pittifull Father, to receive the title of an Obedient Servant.

And ſurely, it was requiſite that the ſame power, which before had armed him, ſhould force the Weapon out of his Hand, and that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould have as much promptitude and reſignation, to leave his Sacrifice, as to undertake and begin it. O God! what myſteries of Wiſdom, Clemency and Goodneſs?

               <p>The Altar of <hi>Moria</hi> which was to be the Scaffold of Death, became the Theater of Life, and his Pile ſerved but to make a Bonfire of Joy, and a triumph of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity which <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaack</hi> teſtified unto God.</p>

               <p>It is ſufficient for this God of Clemencie and mercie, to ſee Men at his Feet; he is content with that Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice which the Heart offers to him, and he will have neither Bloud nor Murther preſented on his Altars.

               </p>
               <p>True it is then that <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> affirms, were the figures of the Chriſtian and <hi>Hebrew</hi> people meant by this Prophecy; And at preſent there is ſcarce any place in the World, where Chriſtianity hath not raiſed her Croſſes as ſo many Trophies upon the ruins of Judaiſm and impiety; <hi>David</hi> vanquiſhed <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> ſaith <hi>Rupertus,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> though the Younger,

               <p>Is not this an early beginning to War with each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſince in their Mothers Womb they began the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine Duel?</p>

               <p>What ever happens, <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhall be vanquiſner; For Heaven is on his ſide, and the ſupplanting of <hi>Eſau</hi> ſhall rather proceed from the Hand of God than that of <hi>Jacob.</hi>

               <p>It is not then the office of <hi>Jacob</hi> to ſupplant his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to ruin the fortune of his moſt intimate friends. They that contrive ſuch deſigns, are not the Imitators of <hi>Jacob,</hi> but the Diſciples of <hi>Cain.</hi>

               <p>But alas! what ſtrife? what victory? what triumph? when the Crowns we gain are but Roſes ſtaind with Bloud, and Laurels which wither in a moment, and transform themſelves into eternall Thorns.</p>

               <p>It is alſo particularly from Mothers (as heretofore ſaid one of the ſeaven Sages of <hi>Greece</hi>) that Good and Evill flows into the Souls of thoſe to whom they give Suck: Hence it ariſeth that Nurſes are ſought out with ſo much care in the Houſes of Great Men,

               <p>Ah! how ingenious is vertue! and how dexterous is Love when it follows the will of God! who would believe that a Woman durſt undertake what <hi>Rebecca</hi> did?

               <p>Can we wiſh more Reſpect, Candor, and Piety, in a Son towards his Father? Surely this did not agree
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:157758:72"/>with the comportments and bad humours of ſo many Children who daily ſell their Fathers and Mothers for ſome ſlight intereſts.

               <p>ALthough wee may ſay that the Earth is a great Labyrinth and a fearfull Chaos where Truth is not ſeen but in ſhadow, and where there are no aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances but amidſt the uncertainty of caſual accidents; Yet One of the Antients had reaſon to ſay, That the world was a large well of Darkneſs, and a deep Sea where we are expoſed to the mercy of Winds and tempeſts without Sayles, without <hi>Pilot,</hi> without Stern, and almoſt without Hope of releif.</p>
               <p>Alas! in this eſtate where is the Haven, where are the <hi>Ilands,</hi> and where is the means to attain the ſhore?
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:157758:73"/>O God! what Horror when wee ſee a bark ſplit in pieces, and him that wee Lold by the hand carried by the billows, and tempeſts into the bottome of the Sea? I ſee him, I hear him, and I behold him in my ſight dying upon the waves; Why he, and not my ſelf? Why this and not that man? What have I done? What hath he done? And what could he deſerve from God even before his birth?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O night without day! Precipice without bottome!
<note place="margin">Dreadfull uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</note> Ocean without ſhore! O hight of the Wiſedom and knowledge of God! Alas how fearfull and horrible are the myſteries of thy ſecrets! My God! When ſhall I know whether thou art for or againſt me? And who will aſſure me that I am not inrould amongſt thoſe wretches which muſt be one day baniſhed out of the land of Paradiſe. Lord, I know not where I am, and what will become of me; I doubt whether after all my races I ſhall waite at the gate, or whether all my labours will ever merit any reward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And truly could <hi>Eſau</hi> have imagined that while he was a hunting his brother had taken his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction?</p>
               <p>Ah!
<note place="margin">A fair ſubject of Miſeries.</note> it often happens that ſuch as have the greateſt advantages of Nature have the leaſt ſhare of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and Graces God is accuſtomed to impart. Blood, Spirit, Extraction and Riches are for the moſt part but a fair object where Misfortune appears with moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity. The Sun is wont to make his rareſt producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the moſt unknown places, and God never works more miracles than in the ſouls of thoſe whom the world uſeth to Deſpiſe, or knows not.</p>
               <p>Unhappy <hi>Eſau!</hi> where are the privileges of thy Birth, where is the right of thy Primogeniture, and the Bleſſing thou doeſt expect? Who art thou? In vain is it for thee to ſay thou art <hi>Eſau,</hi> and the Eldeſt ſon of <hi>Iſaack, Jacob</hi> hath ſupplanted thee, and when thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt hunt he found at home what thou ſoughteſt abroad. <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaying that he was <hi>Eſau</hi> and the Eldeſt ſon, knew
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:157758:74"/>well enough that in effect and according to the right of Nature,
<note place="margin">Myſterious anſwer.</note> he was <hi>Jacob</hi> and the Younger Brother: But he knew alſo that God had choſen him for his Eldeſt Son, and he ſpake according to Gods intentions, and in purſuance of the title and right of Primogeniture which he had purchaſed, and God had given him.</p>
               <p>As in the eleventh and ſeventeenth Chapter of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> the <hi>Meſſias</hi> openly declares that St. <hi>John</hi> was <hi>Elias;</hi> Not that indeed he was <hi>Elias,</hi> but becauſe he lived according to the Spirit, as <hi>Elias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So our Lord alſo hath borrowed ſeeming titles, and God himſelf hath taught the World many things which had but ſome marks of his Divinity.</p>
               <p>We muſt note then by the way for the ſatisfaction of thoſe that read the holy Scripture;</p>
               <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">Innocent feignings.</note> that who ever diſſembles the truth doth not tell a lye, and though it be a ſhamefull and deteſtable thing to tell a lye, yet there be innocent feignings and prudentiall ways which are ſometimes lawfull and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable. Such was (as ſome have believed) the addreſs which <hi>Abraham</hi> uſed when he cauſed his Wife to paſs for his Siſter in the territories of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, it is one thing to lye, and another thing to ſpeak figuratively; And the words of God himſelf, though he be the infallible Verity ought not alwaies to be taken in a rigorous ſenſe: for they have ſometimes Enigmaticall meanings and myſterious relations; and ſo the number of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Children was to be like the Stars, and the Sands of the Sea.</p>
               <p>Thirdly when St.
<note place="margin">A two edged Sword.</note> 
                  <hi>John</hi> in the Ile of <hi>Pathmos</hi> ſaw God carrying in his Mouth a two Edged-Sword, it was to teach us, that his Words, though Divine, might have two ſignifications: which was evident, when he ſpake unto the Jews concerning the Temple of his Body, as if it had been the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> albeit he was not ignorant that their thoughts were very different from what he declared unto them.</p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:157758:74"/>
               <p>Fourthly the greatneſs of a myſtery may without wounding the truth, diſguiſe the countenance, feign a voice, borrow names, and in a word conceal under ſome myſticall terms the importance of a ſecret,
<note place="margin">A moſt juſt Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem.</note> and the deſigns of God. This was, as I may ſay, the ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſtratagem of the Angell <hi>Raphael,</hi> when he ſaid unto <hi>Toby</hi> that he was <hi>Azarias</hi> the Son of the great <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias:</hi> And this was the Artifice of <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered his father that he was <hi>Eſau,</hi> and his Eldeſt Son.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs <hi>Iſaack</hi> ſtood in admiration even to a rapture, and at firſt he could hardly imagin,

               <p>His ſorrows and roarings may well excite ſome pitty in his Fathers Soul. But this poor old Man hath no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to give him but ſome drops of the Dew, and at beſt but ſome humid and clammy vapours which fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Earth. For as concerning Heaven, that hath already powred forth its favours upon <hi>Jacob:</hi> where note, that the benediction which had been given him was very different from that of <hi>Eſau:</hi> for <hi>Jacob</hi> had firſt received Riches and the abundance of the Goods of the Earth; Secondly an Empire over Nations; Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Principality amongſt his Brethren; And laſtly a
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:157758:75"/>particular favour which put him intirely under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of Heaven; whereas <hi>Eſau,</hi> as I ſaid, received for his ſhare but ſome Acres of ground fertile indeed, but only in the corruptible goods of Corn, Rain, and Dew, whereas <hi>Jacob</hi> had all ſorts of benedictions aſwell in Earth as in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Theſe are preſents for Worldly and Earthly Men, drops of Water, Exhalations, Vapors, and a little ſmoak. Behold the favours of <hi>Eſau,</hi> behold the height of his benedictions, and the portion of a Younger Brother who is rejected.</p>
               <p>After this let us ask why the moſt impious perſons in the World are ſometimes the richeſt, the moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and the moſt powerfull, or at leaſt in appearance and to the Eyes of Fleſh and Bloud. Let us inquire whence comes it that Atheiſts are Crowned with Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Lillys, and Gilly-flowers, when Chriſtians walk upon Bryars and Thorns, what a ſhame will it be to ſee Vice watered with <hi>Nectar,</hi> whilſt Vertue is beaten with a ſtorm of Hail.</p>
               <p>My God!
<note place="margin">Bleſſings of this World.</note> permit me then to expoſtulate with thee to this purpoſe; if <hi>Eſau</hi> be rejected, why doſt thou beſtow on him ſome Goods in this World? Alas! what can be the happineſs of this Life? A thick Cloud of Rain, Lands ſmoking with Ordures, Straw, Hey, Feathers and Wind: whereas the Elect enjoy Peace, Hope, Love, Pleaſure, God, and Paradiſe for all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</p>
               <p>But who will aſſure us that we are in the fortunate Liſt of thoſe predeſtinated Perſons whoſe Elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Jacob</hi> is? what Angell will tell us whether we be not loſt Children who have <hi>Eſau</hi> for our Captain?</p>
               <p>Ah God! I have bewayled my ſins, but I fear my tears have not cleanſed my Heart, I have caſt forth cryes, ſighs, and ſobs, but my doubt is I have not been heard. I know not how far my benediction reacheth, and whether ſome-body hath not ſupplanted me. In

               <p>My God, I hope to be one of thoſe who ſhall behold thee face to face in Heaven; it is the hope in which I will live, and die.

<note place="margin">A ſenſible Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> farewell all my Joy, and all the Love of my houſe; which ſaid, he kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him, he embraces him, he waters him with his tears.

               <p>I wonder how the Father, Mother and Son did not die upon this ſad Separation.

<note place="margin">The deſcription of a perfect Soul.</note> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the picture of a Soul, which raiſeth her ſelf unto the higheſt pitch of Perfection.</p>

<note place="margin">The forſaking of Creatures.</note> and that this Soul may aſcend unto God, ſhee muſt forſake the Earth, and renounce the World: This is the firſt ſtep.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſhee ought to make a generous divorce from all Creatures, and even efface out of her memory all their Footſteps, and all the ſpecies of her deareſt affections.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,
<note place="margin">Contempt of the World.</note> ſhee muſt have nothing but Contempt and disdain for that which before ſhee adored.</p>
               <p>At the fourth ſtep ſhee muſt reſolve to trample over her Friends and all her kindred;
<note place="margin">Eſtimation of God.</note> that is to ſay, ſhee muſt preferr God before them, and boldly reject their deſigns when they are oppoſite unto the Will of God.</p>
               <p>The fift ſtep paſſeth even unto Death:
<note place="margin">Extreme Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> for the Soul ought leſſe to eſteem Life than her God; and if God ſuffers her to live Longer, her life is but a Living Death which finds its Tomb in her Nothing.</p>

               <p>IT is then the wiſe Providence of God, which can juſtly attribute this honour unto it ſelf as to ſay, I preſide in Councils; And it is by the favour of my lights Men in the moſt importune affairs conceive their graveſt and moſt mature reſolutions.</p>
               <p>I am,
<note place="margin">The Works of the increated Wiſdom.</note> ſaith Providence, the End of Gods wonders; by me he Begins his rareſt works to Finiſh them in me; And I am the Archetype and the project of his moſt admirable deſigns. It is this Providence which had the Modell of the Univerſe, when the Elements were in confuſion, and it was by her diſpoſure the world re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived its Laws and all its Orders.</p>
               <p>Moreover, in the ſequence of Age ſhe took all her choiceſt delights upon the vaſt Globe of the Earth, and her ſweeteſt divertiſements amongſt men, which ſerve as paſtimes to her moſt holy entertainments.</p>
               <p>I know not whether the Philoſophy of <hi>Plato</hi> were pure enough to underſtand theſe verities; But he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred it ſeems in this opinion, when he ſaid, That di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence ſports with men in a way paternally affectionate and full of miracles.
<note place="margin">Homo eſt ludus De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum. Plato.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now if this Paſtime appeared in the life of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and <hi>Iſaack,</hi> it is no leſs viſible, me thinks, in that of <hi>Jacob.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Admirable ſports.</note> Firſt, God ſported with him in his Mothers Womb, when he ſtirred his Hand to wraſtle with his Brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> and to take him by the ſoal of his Foot that he might cauſe him to fall from the right to which he pretended.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God ſported with <hi>Jacob</hi> when he diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him by the intervention of his Mother to obtain the Benediction of <hi>Iſaack.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly the Ladder <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaw in a dream was, as
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:157758:80"/>we have ſaid, but a Paſtime and ſpectacle of the Divine Providence, and at preſent God continues to ſport with him in the reſt of his Journey, afterwards in the Houſe of <hi>Laban,</hi> and finally in a thouſand other rencounters, where it will appear that even Gods Combats with <hi>Jacob</hi> were but Sports and Artifices wherein God took pleaſure to recreate himſelf with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jacob</hi> being then wak'd out of this myſterious ſleep and Divine rapture,

In like manner the River <hi>Seamander</hi> breeds golden colours: And in the red Sea there is a fountain as <hi>Varro</hi> obſerves which changeth every thing into Carnation.</p>
               <p>It is then no impoſſible thing for the imagination to produce like effects, and to form in Bodyes, what the Sun doth in the clouds, and Painters in their pictures. Theſe are draughts of the Soul which in the ſtrict Union ſhee hath with the Body is the ſource of its Actions and Motions;
<note place="margin">Portraicts of the Soul.</note> ſo that ſhe labors therein as a Workman doth upon his Matter, and a Deſigner upon the Platform which he contrived. And truly if a Carver can ſhape up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Marble and Braſs the intelligible form and the Idea which is in his Fancy and Reaſon; What diſorder can there be, if the Senſitive Soul, the Fancy of Animals chance to produce their Senſible Images in the matter moſt capable of theſe impreſſions, when the Heat of Nature incites them to dilate themſelves into new Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions? In fine, but too many events are daily ſeen in the world which prove this verity, and demonſtrat that the Imagination hath a Marvelous command over Bodyes.</p>
               <p>This yet hinders not <hi>Jacob</hi> from following the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincts of a Supernaturall conduct to purchaſe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his Services deſerved.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Jacob</hi> mean while took notice of theſe Dreams as ſo many Preſages of ſome truth:
<note place="margin">Pater verò rem taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus conſiderabat.</note> For he knew that the moſt part of Nightly imaginations are commonly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall effects, which proceed either from repletion, emptineſs, or the <hi>Ideas</hi> we have in the Day time, or elſe from ſome illuſions of the Devil: yet he was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that the Dreams of <hi>Joſeph</hi> were no imaginary fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures and confuſed vapors, nor phantaſms, diſordered exhalations, nor the ſmokes and flames of a preceding Fire; nor in fine, ſpecters and Idols of a tenebrous power; but Draughts, Ciphers, and myſterious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations, which God or ſome Angell had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in his Soul. It is of this fourth kind of dreams, <hi>Philo</hi> ſpake in anexpreſs Treatiſe, and it is that alone which <hi>Chryſippus</hi> defined,
<note place="margin">Chryſip. ex cit. lib. de divin.</note> ſaying, A Dream is a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall vertue and a Divine Ray which Heaven hath caſt into our Souls, and of which they make uſe, to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the ſhadows which are wont to hide truth from our Eyes. And it is the Hand of God, or the Pencil
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:157758:90"/>of an Intelligence which then renders Images intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible whoſe <hi>Idea's</hi> and originals reſide in the ſource of Eſſences, and whoſe colours are in the myſterious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of time and Eternity.</p>
               <p>Such was <hi>Joſephs</hi> viſion: But <hi>Jacob</hi> knowing on the one ſide, that this Revelation was but a Copy of the Deſigns God had on him; And on the other ſide ſeeing that this was but a ground of ſcandall, hatred, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to his Brethren, he reſolved to ſever them for a time, to the end by this ſeparation in their abſence, he might ſmother all theſe Fires which were inkindled by the Goodneſs of the one, and the Malice of the reſt.</p>
               <p>For this purpoſe <hi>Jacob</hi> had no other expedient than to retain <hi>Joſeph</hi> in his Houſe,
<note place="margin">Pate</note> and to ſend all his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren into the Country. Imagining beſides, that by ſeparating Bodies, he might reunite their Minds, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their paſſions. But this was only to ſever a Dove from Vultures, and Sheep from Wolves; it only whets their naturall rage and mortall Antipathy, when they are with-held from their prey, and when they ſent it a far off.</p>
               <p>I know that the Fields are innocent. But they ceaſe not for all this to be retreits for Criminals. The ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarineſs of Woods and Meadows is the Element of Meekneſs and Peace: but we muſt bring thither tame Hearts, and quiet Souls.</p>
               <p>In fine, it is a very ſweet and pleaſing vocation to guide Sheep and Lambs upon Hils and Dales: But if Lions be their conductors, they are ſo far from being changed, as on the contrary they will find every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment new baits and allurements to inflame their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</p>

                     </note> my</hi> Joſeph! <hi>it is not ſo much thy death I deplore, as the loſs I procured to my ſelf, during thy life, by ſending thee too ſoon out of my houſe; And beſides, by what more ſtrange kind of death couldſt thou be taken from me? At leaſt if I had been a witneſs of this ſad ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, and if thy body had remained with me, I ſhould
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:157758:93"/>have had this chaſt pledge to charm my ſadneſs. If ſome ſickneſs had carried thee away in my preſence, I ſhould have rendred thee all the duties which a father cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a ſonne; I ſhould have kiſſed thy mouth, I ſhould have cloſed thine eyes, I ſhould have received thy laſt words and ſighes; I ſhould poſſeſs in a Tomb the aſhes of a Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix, and I might have erected on his Sepulcher a Pile and Altar to enlighten my hopes, and entertain my vows. But I ſnatch'd away thy life, before thy death. I loſt thee during thy life, and my exceſſive compliance hath been the cauſe of it.</hi> My ſon, I have loſt thee, I have ſlain thee, and I know not where is thy Tombe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O Heaven! O God! Alas! at leaſt had the toyles of his journey left him at the foot of ſome Tree, or had he been buried in ſome corner of the Earth, I ſhould enjoy the contentment to ſeek him out, and I ſhould comfort my ſelf in poſſeſsing but a part of my ſon with the loſs of the other. But O the moſt diſconſolate, and the moſt unhappy of all fathers! I can have nothing of my</hi> Joſeph <hi>but this bloudy garment, the reſt hath been devoured by ſome Tyger or Lyon, and the ſame ſweetneſs hath no other Tombe, but the belly of a wild beaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yes ſurely, it was a wilde Beaſt, and a cruell Monſter which devoured my <hi>Joſeph.</hi> It was the Envy of his Brethren which gave them Talons, Clawes and Teeth. It was this mercileſs paſſion which ſtript him of his garment, caſt him into the Well, and ſhamefully ſold him.</p>
               <p>Behold the Domeſtick Monſter which will never be made tame, behold the bloudy beaſt which lives onely upon the fleſh and heart of its like. In fine, it is envy againſt which fathers and mothers muſt be alwaies ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and which they ought to baniſh for ever out of their families, for as much as,</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is a <hi>Cantharides,</hi>

               <p>Secondly, it is leſſe reaſonable, by how much it hath more of Reaſon: For being found onely amongſt men, it renders them more inhumane than beaſts, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be moved by theſe tragick inſtigations.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the furies of Envy are ſo ſhamefull, as they ſeek alwayes to paſs under the colour of ſome other paſſion.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, its breath, though ſtinking, faſtens on vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but the ſtings of it are as honourable to that perſon who bears them, as infamous to him that cauſeth them.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, it hath the eyes of an Owl, which are dazled at the ſight of the faireſt lights, and which cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the ſplendor of a moſt luminous day.
<note place="margin">Baſilius in Homil. de Invid.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, it hath more cruell tallons and teeth than Tygers and Dragons; for it ſpares neither parents, friends, nor benefactors.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, its nouriſhment, repoſe, and delight, are in bitterneſs and acerbity: Hence it proceeds that the mouth and heart of it are ſtill infectious.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, it is a Viper which draws death upon it ſelf, in giving life unto her young, and tears its own belly to produce ſome venemous Serpent.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, it is a Camelion which converts it ſelf into a thouſand colours, and every moment changeth its skin leaſt we diſcern its nature and inclination.</p>
               <p>In fine, it is a monſtrous <hi>Cerberus,</hi> which hath the heart and head of all the moſt dreadfull Animals under heaven.

               </head>
               <p>IT is true that Envy is a ravenous beaſt: But yet what ever we may ſay, its furies are not to be compared with thoſe of Love when it hath once broken the chains wherewith God and Nature faſtned it. It is this Devill which diſturbs Families, arms Provinces, ruines States, deſolates Paradiſe, and peoples Hell. It is a flaming Torch which inkindles fires even in the midſt of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a Northern wind which raiſeth a Thouſand Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, a Lightning which conſumes mens Spirits, and in fine, it is a Paſſion ever blind, yet covered over with Eyes, which ſerve it as gates by which it uſeth to ſteal in under perfidious Baits and inchanting Looks.
<note place="margin">Deadly ſhafts.</note> It was for this reaſon the prophane painted their Loves with darts of death, which they caſt at each other, and which, as a Grecian ſayd, were as ſo many glances which they wantonly gave one another, though their Eyes ought to be veiled. But Love hath inſolence enough to lift up the Scarfe which covers its Eyes, or at leaſt it ſees not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this veil, and commonly it mingles ſhafts and glances to commit Sacrileges and Murthers. This homicide layes ten Thouſand Snares, he is alwayes watchfull, and there is no Dove this Vulture aſſaults not as ſoon as ſhe appears; and when by miſhap he hath ſeized on her, I know not by what Inchantment, and by what Spells, the heart of this unfortunate prey is taken: But it ſeems in an Inſtant to become a Furnace, and that the flames inkindled therein iſſuing through the Eyes, may change the Earth into a Pyle.

All her bonds of Marriage were but Chains which kept her in Captivity, and the moſt juſt, and moſt holy Lawes impoſed on her, a Yoak which rendred all the duties of ſidelity, which Wives owe unto their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, inſupportable to her. She yet wanted not dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity to diſſemble her Paſſion in her Husbands pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; and herein Love is uſually moſt diſloyall and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull: for though all its fires be violent, impetuous, ſharp and ſparckling, yet if the object which inkindles them be not preſent, they prove but aſhes, coldneſſes, and frozen Nights, under which this Traitor uſeth to hide his Torch;
<note place="margin">Pernitious ſtudy.</note> Then all Actions are ſtudied, all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures counterfeits, all diſcourſes falſhoods, and all that appears outwardly ſeems to have no other deſign than to deceive the heart. To this effect we ſeek out ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Meſſengers, retirements for aſſigned meetings, blind, dumb, and deaf witneſſes, ſecret Intelligences, inchanted gifts, inviſible pretences, painted and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious devotions, Nights without dayes and hours
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:157758:95"/>which are only marked out upon ſhadows; for the light of the Sun, the noiſe of a Bell, too apparent impiety, too viſible preſents, too violent ſolicitations, indiſcreet confederates, publick places, and Friends, or unfaithfull Servants might diſcover the ſecret.</p>
               <p>It is a ſtrange thing that we can hardly truſt our ſelves, and that the Tongue dares not ſpeak a word, or at leaſt if ſhe ſpeaks, it is but after ſhe hath pondered all her diſcourſes. Wherefore the Eyes are the firſt ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citours of evill, and then their ſilence hath an Eloquent voice, which is yet not heard, but by thoſe that are Confederates.</p>

               <p>In vain is it to ſay that Virginity hath power to erect Altars in Souls, and to Conſecrate them unto God. I know what that glorious and chaſt Martyr, who bore in
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:157758:98"/>his breaſt the pureſt and moſt holy of all names ſaid of it. I know alſo that a Virgin-ſoul is a living Temple, and a Sanctuary where thoſe Fires are alwaies ſeen, which God alone, and his Angels have inkindled. But if this Temple be once open to all goers and commers, and this ſo famous Sentence, which baniſheth from thence all ſorts of impuritie, be not ingraven on the gate, immediately we ſhall ſee all the Torches extinguiſhed, and impure and Laſcivious <hi>Megeraes</hi> will be ſo bold as to take place of the Veſtals.

               <p>The reaſon is, becauſe God, being as it were obliged to be in a particular manner preſent, where Virtue is, we muſt needs be inſenſible in the preſence of him who imprints Senſe in all beings, if we were not excited to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Virtue and Sanctity, which reſemble thoſe Spirits who incompaſs the Sanctuary, and thoſe Souls in whom God is delighted.</p>

Behold, why the Saints have done ſo many wonders; and it is for this reaſon we have ſeen Tyrants waxing pale at the ſight of Martyrs; Tygers changing their nature; and all the Elements, though inſenſible, ſeeming reaſonable, to obey them. We muſt not fear then that any ill will befall thoſe whom God poſſeſſeth, whom God conducteth, and in whom he lives as the life of their Souls.</p>

                  <hi>JOſeph</hi> having ſpent two years in Priſon, it chanced that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> during a Dream, imagined he was on the bank of a great River, out of which iſſued ſeven goodly and fat Kine, which were going to feed in the Marſhes. Preſently after, he thought he ſaw ſeven o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ugly and lean Kine, which comming out of the water paſſed along the Banks, and fed in the Meadows. But that graſſe could not ſatisfie their hunger, for they devoured the firſt ſeven, and what ſeemed more ſtrange, after they had filled their bellyes, to ſee them, one would have believed that they had ſwallowed down nothing but wind, ſo hungry they appeared.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pharaoh</hi> awaking thereupon, and the myſtery having appeared to him but in part; Providence which would manifeſt it ſelf to him entire, ſhewed him in a ſecond ſleep ſeven fair Eares Loaden with Corn, which grew upon the ſelf-ſame ſtalk. This Dream would have been pleaſing, if he had not afterwards, ſeen ſeven other Eares ſhrivel'd, and dry'd up by the ardors of the Sun, and which ſpread themſelves in an inſtant to ſwallow up

               <head>CHAP. V. <hi>The Government of</hi> Joſeph <hi>in</hi> Egypt.</head>
               <p>IT is not without reaſon, Fortune hath Wings at her Feet, and that ſhe is alwaies flying on a little Globe, where Life and Death, Places and Seaſons, and in a word, all the accidents of Nature hinder her from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any reſt. I know not who hath placed a veil o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her Eyes leſt we ſhould perceive her too volatile and too haggard looks.
<note place="margin">Picture of Fortune.</note> Her Hair is ſo plated and drawn down upon her forehead, as to behold her, we would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the hinder part of her Head were bald, like that of Time. Her Garment is of changeable Taffety, her Gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle is mark'd with certain ſmall Ciphers ſo confuſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put together, as nothing can be underſtood by them. This correſponds with her words and geſtures, which are full of myſteries and ambiguity. In fine, all that ſhe hath, all that ſhe doth, and all that ſhe ſaith, is no other than a Chaos of Inconſtancy and Diſloyalty: whence it comes to paſs that all her attendants lament, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe that deſtiny, which hath ſo miſerably deceived them, and which after many thouſand promiſes, and gifts, hath left them nothing but Wind, Tears, Smoak, Deſpair, and after all a precipice or an Abyſs of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes.</p>
               <p>Behold the deſtinies of this World, and the Fortunes of Men! on which nevertheleſs they are accuſtomed to fix their hopes.</p>
               <p>We are delighted with this Game,
<note place="margin">

                  </note> in which, as a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Pope hath obſerved, there is nothing but hazard; We deſire to aſcend the top of this Ladder, from which we muſt alwaies deſcend, ſaith <hi>Philo,</hi> after we have aſcended; There are ſome who think themſelves happy to appear on this Theater, though their end for the moſt part will be Tragical; It ſeems that it ſatisfies many perſons, to have a propitious Gale when they
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:157758:103"/>depart out of the Haven,
<note place="margin">Apud Eraſm. Stob. ſer. de prud.</note> though ſoon after they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a ſorrowfull Shipwrack. Theſe nevertheleſs, are the Sports, Exerciſes, Acts, Courſes, and Navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Fortune and Deſtiny, which Men ſtrive to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh in humane things. We gain thereby to loſe, we riſe up to fall, we appear to periſh, we imbarque our ſelves to ſplit on a Rock.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, in the Deſigns God hath on Men, all is Conſtant and fixt, his Scales are even, his looks loving, his Ciphers eternall, and there is nothing in his amiable providences, either deceitfull or hazardous;
<note place="margin">The happineſs of Providence.</note> And if they ſport with us it is to inrich us; when they caſt us down it is to raiſe us up; His Theaters have no funeſtous Acts, and it ſufficeth that his Providence guides us into the Haven. This being ſo, what ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? what aſſurance? and what happineſs to follow this Light? It matters not to meet with Labyrinths, Precipices, Sepulchers, and Rocks, ſoon or late we ſhalbe freed from them.</p>
               <p>Well may <hi>Joſeph</hi> have been betrayed, he may have been thrown into the bottom of a Pit, he may have been diveſted, &amp; ſold as a ſlave, I mean that he was kept in Priſon for the ſpace of two years; If our Lord be with him, and if the Providence of God be his Miſtreſs, he is happy, and ſhall come forth like a Planet, which Iſſueth more Glorious and with more Luſtre, out of the midſt of Darkneſs, and the Eclipſes which had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured it.</p>
               <p>The Wiſdom of the World, which in the ſight of God is but meer folly, would never yet have believed it, and truly who would have imagined, that <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſhould have found Lights in the Darkneſs of a Priſon, which were to guide him even to the Throne of <hi>Pharao.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He is yet there, and this King doth not believe that there is any perſon in the World more capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Lieutenant, and who could more wiſely, and with more dexterity govern the Kingdom of <hi>Egypt,</hi>

               <p>Secondly he reſolv'd to follow all the orders which <hi>Joſeph</hi> had affirmed to be neceſſary for the good of the State. Afterwards, addreſſing himſelf unto <hi>Joſeph</hi> with paternall tenderneſs he ſaid unto him.</p>
               <p>Joſeph, <hi>I will ſeek no further for a Man to ſhare with me in the cares of my Empire. Heaven hath ordained you for it, and I cannot oppoſe it.

               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Pharaoh</hi> for his part ſent the people to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who during the time of his proſperity had done like Bees, and thoſe Birds indued with fore-ſight, which du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Summer ſtore up food for the Winter.</p>
               <p>Behold a Draught of the World,
<note place="margin">The Image of the world.</note> in which the blind Men and Sages of <hi>Egypt</hi> have no eyes, but for the time preſent.

               <p>But ſome would peradventure ask what expedient can be found to avert all theſe dangers? Firſt it is certain
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:157758:105"/>that God for his part will never fail to provide all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, and having created Man, he is as it were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to his conſervation. Secondly, the Planets have their regular courſes, and maugre all their Defections, Aſcendents, Retrogradations, Conjunctions, Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Elevations, they are alwaies conſtant in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our good, and their nature is too pure to be cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous of thoſe Treaſures which are hid in their Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Thirdly the Fire, the Water, the Ayr, and the Earth have no enmity amongſt themſelves, but for our ſakes, and if they be at War, it is but to bring us Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Peace.</p>
               <p>I demand then again, whence can proceed thoſe evils which befall men, and which are born even in their Cradles, to die with them.
<note place="margin">Our Evils come from our ſelves.</note> I fear that the Lieutenants of <hi>Egypt</hi> did not often imitate <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and that they ſlept during the calm, and when Fortune ſmiled upon them on every ſide.

Truth, although hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den under Abyſſes, covered with the ſhades of a Tomb, and buried in the obſcurities of night, hath rayes which eſcape through Rocks, paſſe under Marble ſtones, and which cleave all the Clouds to break forth like light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and inkindle fires upon the aſhes and bones which
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:157758:106"/>were thought inſenſible and uncapable of complaints for obtaining revenge. Woe to that Man, ſaith the moſt wiſe <hi>Jeſus</hi> the ſon of <hi>Sirach,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Omnis bomo qui tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greditur lectum ſuum dicit in corde ſuo quis me videt? tenebrae circumdant me, &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo me videt, quid vereor? Eccles.</hi> 23.</note> who not being Satisfied with his own bed, ſaith in his Heart, who is it that ſees me? Night and darkneſs inviron me on all ſides, walls like ſo many Dungeons ſhelter me from thoſe troubleſome and Dangerous eyes which might be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of my actions, what can I then fear?</p>
               <p>Ah! blind that thou art, thou ſeeſt not the Sun which over theſe ſhadows marks out thy ſentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. Thou ſeeſt not the Moon and ſtarrs which are the Eyes of Heaven,
<note place="margin">Nocte quidem ſed Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na videt, ſed ſydera teſtes, Intendunt oculos.</note> and the torches which God makes uſe of to manifeſt his will.</p>
               <p>Poor man, thou art deaf if thou doeſt not hear it, and if amidſt the ſighs of thy conſcience thou beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that-no body ſpeaks unto thee, but ſoon or late thou ſhalt confeſſe that innocence and truth are too dear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and that one cannot offend them, without Heavens arming it ſelf in their defence. Nevertheleſſe they are patient enough to ſuffer them for a time: But they are too generous to be always ſilent; and it would be too cruell an indulgence, and too pernicious unto Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue if they might diſſemble for an Eternity.</p>
               <p>God and kings have armes which extend themſelves to all places, and if the world be a great Chain, as <hi>Tris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megiſtus</hi> heretofore beleev'd, it is to keep men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chain'd, and to the end they may reſt aſſur'd that in all times and every where an officer follows them,
<note place="margin">Conſcience an inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable guardian.</note> and holds them faſt by the Eyes, by the Hand, and by all the powers of their Souls.</p>
               <p>The prophane were of this opinion, ſaying, That all men, and univerſally all Creatures moved in a great Labyrinth, in which the Gods delighted to hold them by a ſilken thread, as heretofore <hi>Ariadne</hi> did, when in her Maze ſhe guided her dear <hi>Theſeus,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like birdcatchers who tie a thread to the foot of ſome bird, that giving him Liberty, they may ſtay him when they pleaſe.</p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:157758:106"/>
               <p>So God hath inviſible bands, which men cannot break and if they be Criminall, vengeance which is inexora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble will ſoon or late inflict on them the puniſhment they have merited.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stay then guilty Brethren, come and caſt your ſelves at the Feet of this ſlave you have Sold. Come and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand life of him whom you had deſigned for death. Come and ſee on a Thron this Dreamer whoue you threw into a Pit. The Whale hath caſt this Prophet into the harbor. This Angel is come ſafe and ſound out of the furnace. His priſon is the Empire of Egypt, his chains are the golden Ornaments of the King, the whole world adores him, and from henceforth he is goeing to be the Father, Lord, and Judge of thoſe who have been his Tyrants, perſecutors and executioners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Three and Twenty years are paſt ſince <hi>Jofeph</hi> left his Fathers Houſe, and ſince his brethren exerciſed on him all ſorts of Hoſtility. Theſe Monſters Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing covered themſelves with the Robe of this Lamb, and they hitherto paſſed for innocents, but God, who purſues the culpable, and Juſtice which is leſſe Seperable from Evill than ſhadows are from bodyes, made them come a foot from their Country to th'end they might be puniſhed by his hand, who ſerved for a Subject to their rage and cruelty.

               <head>CHAP. VII. Jacob <hi>reſolves to ſend</hi> Benjamin <hi>into</hi> Egypt.</head>
               <p>IN the world there are inexorable Caves, and fatall neceſſities which can hardly be avoided: We muſt often ſwim over the arms of the Sea, not to periſh in the midſt of the Ocean;
<note place="margin">Fatall neceſſities.</note> and ſome there are who reſolve rather to dye ſtifled with ſmoak, than to fall into a fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fire.</p>
               <p>Nothing is to be preferred before life next unto God and Honour, and we uſually give what we have to preſerve it. It is for this reaſon, with our hands we keep off the Darts which are thrown at our hearts, and there is no part of the body which ſerves not for a Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler when life is to be ſaved. In fine, the fear of Death is a blind paſſion which knowes neither Friends nor Children. <hi>Jacob</hi> then muſt ſuffer his <hi>Benjamin</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part: but it is not without much grief, and without fighting many battells with a Love ſo Cordial, and an affection a Father ought to have for a Child ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be beloved.</p>
               <p>He muſt dye then of Famin, or <hi>Benjamin</hi> muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part: But it is not enough that the reſt return, and this dear Child remain with his Father. No,

               <p>It was at this, theſe poor men were aſtoniſhed, for ſince they did not expect ſo good a reception, they fear'd leſt the Hall into which they were brought, might be changed into their Priſon, and that the Dinner pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them might prove their laſt repaſt; they then whiſpered in each others ear, that without doubt they were drawn into danger by reaſon of the Money which had been found in their Sacks; and that infallibly there was an intention to make them undergoe the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a crime of which they were no wayes guilty. This ſaid, they run after their Conductor, and having Stayd him at the door, they related to him what had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; proteſting that they knew not who had deſigned them this miſchief, and beſides, that they had never the leaſt thought of his Money; in witneſs whereof they had brought it with the ſurpluſage ſumme which was neceſſary to buy their Commodities. No, no, anſwered he, you need not fear any thing, Peace be with you, it is your God, and the Lord of your Father who hath put into your Sacks the Money you found in them. As for that which you gave me it is very good, and you ought not to diſquiet your ſelf concerning it. This ſaid, <hi>Simeon</hi> was conducted to them, and then they brought water to waſh their feet. In the interim they prepare their Preſents in expectation of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who intended to dine with them.</p>

                  <hi>Yes,</hi> anſwered they, <hi>your moſt humble Servant, and our moſt honoured Father is yet living, and as we believe, in perfect health. Saying this, they all bowed down before him, and rendred their duties in the moſt affectionate manner it was poſſible for them to doe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After all theſe honours <hi>Joſeph</hi> lifting up his eyes, and perceiving <hi>Benjamin,</hi> then demanding whether he were not the youngeſt amongſt them whom they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mentioned, he ſaid unto him; <hi>Ah! my Son, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech God to have pitty on thee, and to take thee into his holy protection:</hi> Now he perceived that his heart was ready to diſcharge by his eyes, part of the affection, joy and compaſſion wherwith he was touched at the ſight of <hi>Benjamin:</hi> which obliged him to leave them ſuddenly, and to retire into his Chamber to weep his fill. The eyes are not onely the gates of light, but alſo of all paſſions; Amongſt others, Love and Mercy make their entries and ſallies by them. Sometimes alſo Joy becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſo exceſſive, paſſeth through theſe Chriſtall gates, and it ſeems that theſe living Mirrours are conſtrained to melt at the ſame inſtant the Soul hath received ſome darts from the hand of Love, Pitty and Joy. The moſt generous ſpirits are commonly moſt ſubject unto theſe ſweet tenderneſſes. The moſt unworthy are thoſe which never weep; and ſurely as they have but Souls of Aſhes, ſo their eyes are alwaies dry: But on the contrary, a good Spirit being in the Body as a great River in a bed of Sand,
<note place="margin">Decent tenderneſs.</note> the leaſt wind can hardly riſe without break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down its banks, and eſcaping at leaſt by the two Eyes, which are as ſo many Chanels through which the Spirit disburthens it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Now as there may be many cauſes of this inundation, ſo we ſhould often fear that it might happen either in the day, or in publick: For there would be ſome danger
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:157758:112"/>that without Ink and Paper, ſecrets might be written on our Cheeks with that water which flowes from our eyes; We might often alſo accuſe of weakneſs, even the moſt noble, and moſt generous Sentiments of our hearts: In fine, there be ſeaſons, dayes and places in which we ought not to ſpeak but by ſilence, and where the Eyes as well as the Tongue ſhould be dumb.</p>

                  <hi>Joſeph</hi> could not reſtrain his tears at the ſight of <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin;</hi> but it was a moſt prudent Act to withdraw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to pay this tribute unto the goodneſs of his mind, and to an object worthy of pitty, Joy and affection.</p>

Above all, it is a common ſaying, ſaith <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> that grief and pleaſures make the faireſt and moſt deformed faces in the world. Theſe two Paſſions are on the Earth, what the Sun and Moon are in the Heavens. They cauſe day and night, Spring and Winter; but we have more frequently Snows than Dewes. And moſt Men ſeem to be born under a frightfull Climate, where the night laſts three and twenty hours, and where the Sun very ſeldome appears. Beſides, it is often doubtfull, whether it be the Sun or Moon we behold.

               <p>As for the Sacrifice, in the firſt place, what <hi>Jacob</hi> did ought to be an inſtruction to all thoſe who leave their Country, and intend to alter the courſe of their lives, that before all things they ſhould conſult with God, and take him for their guide, in the Voyages, &amp; deſigns they take in hand: for it is unto him we ought firſt to Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſe our hearts, and immolate all our hopes, otherwiſe we ſhall look behind us like that wavering Woman, who for her inconſtancy was turned into a Statue of Salt.</p>

               <p>Secondly, the apparition of God which <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaw, is a certain token, that his eye ſtill watcheth over thoſe who dedicate themſelves unto him; and that he is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deaf nor dumb to thoſe that ſpeak unto him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Gods promiſe is too faithfull, and his Love too generous to forſake thoſe who walk in his wayes, and have taken him for their guide.</p>

                  <hi>Sir, for the ſpace of a hundred and thirty years I have been a Pilgrim on the Earth. This journey truly is very ſhort, if you onely conſider its durance; but very long, if you caſt your eyes on the miſeries of my life; Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, I am not yet arrived to the Term of my Fore-fathers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Few old men will be found in the World who may not ſay the ſame: For life is but a courſe, in which we go from our Cradle to the Tomb. Dayes, months years, and entire Ages are but moments in the ſight of God. Man is but but a Flower which begins to blow at the break of day, to fade about Noon, and to drop a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way at night. He is a ſhadow which paſſeth away, a Feather which flyes, a Reed which breaks, an Image which loſeth its Luſter, a Vapour which is diſſipated, a Beauty which periſheth, a breath, a ſmoak, and a puff of Air, which ſwells in the midſt of a ſtorm, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears on the water to diſſolve at the ſame inſtant.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, we need no longer ſpace to ſee and feel much miſery: For it is enough to be born of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to be conſumed with ſorrows, and to ſerve as a pittifull Subject to all ſorts of Accidents;
<note place="margin">Viciſſitudes of life.</note> Witneſs <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> who was no ſooner come into the World, but he muſt leave his Fathers houſe to go from thence with a ſtaff in his hand into Forein Countries, and like a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive, to ſhun the perſecution of his Brother. We need but follow him in this ſad journey, and ſpend with him Twenty years in quality of a Servant at <hi>Labans</hi> houſe; From thence we muſt depart out of <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> and bondage, to expoſe our ſelves unto dangers of Death, and to meet with <hi>Eſau,</hi> who comes to aſſail him with four hundred men. We muſt ſee him in the affrightment he took, at the Murther his Children committed upon the Sichemites. Had he not alſo ſome cauſe to die at the death of <hi>Rachel,</hi> and to expire on her body, which
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:157758:121"/>incloſed the moitie of his life? But who could behold the ſorrow which pierc'd his heart, when his Children were ſo impudent, as to bring inceſt even into his houſe? Surely he would have ſaid that his life was but a web of misfortunes, if we joyn with it the loſs of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> the ſeparation of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> the captivity of <hi>Simeon,</hi> and finally his laſt departure out of <hi>Chanaan;</hi>

                  <hi>My Son, it is time for me to dye, there is no appeal. I goe whither</hi> Abraham <hi>and</hi> Iſaack <hi>are gone before, and you ſhall come thither after me.

I have ſeen ſtanders by, bath'd in tears, and yet their hearts fill'd with Joy, receiving the laſt words and benedictions of dying men. I know that the like effects are ſometimes ſeen in the world; and there have bin ſome Kings and Queens, Fathers and Mothers, Men and Women, of all ſtates and conditions, who have ſpoken on their death-beds with ſo much Judgement and force of ſpirit, as if they had been upon a Throne, or in a Pulpit. Likewiſe from thence Edicts, Lawes, and Leſſons are heard, in which there can be no deceit nor diſguiſment. But it will be granted me, that theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples are very rare amongſt thoſe whoſe lives paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in noiſe and tumult: For Death is an Eccho which anſwers life, and a night which reſents the Calm, or elſe the Storms of the day which preceded. And truly, what can a dying man ſay, who hath lived in the intriges of Fortune, in the Labyrinth of Law-ſuites, in the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances of a Family, in an abyſſe of paſſions, and in a hell of Miſeries? after this, what can you expect from theſe infortunate Parents, and from theſe miſerable friends, which cannot ſay any thing to themſelves, but that they are hopeleſſe? Ah! what farewell? what ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration? and what kind of death?</p>
               <p>Children of Saints, predeſtinate Souls, happy Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of <hi>Jacob,</hi> fall not into theſe precipices, but follow the way and tracks which are marked out to you by your fore-fathers. And thou, my dear Reader, build at leaſt an Oratory in thy heart, and make a Temple of thy houſe, and an Altar of thy Bed, where thou maiſt offer unto God, what thou haſt, what thou art, and what thou haſt been. In fine, have then words in thy mouth for thy ſelf, for thy Children and Friends, to the end ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given thy benediction to thoſe that have deſerved it, thou maiſt obtain the bleſſing of God, who is thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thy King, thy Maker, and thy laſt end.</p>

A man muſt have the ſoul of a Tyger to be devoyd of grief and reſentment for the miſeries of a Parent or friend, then chiefly when he either hears them related, or is a witneſs of them.

The wiſeſt Philoſophy hath far better Maxims, and one of her Axiomes is, that There are times &amp; occaſions which require ſentiments of Joy, and other ſeaſons which demand expreſſions of grief. And truly were it a hanſome thing to ſee a Son with a ſmiling countenance and dry eyes at the Tomb of his father? It would be a ſtrange ſpectacle to ſee him in the midſt of a banquet, and at a Ball, when his Father is laid in the earth; and I would willingly know a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt what nations, and in what ſect, there are lawes which diſpenſe with what is due unto the ſweet memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the living and dead.

               <p>Witneſs <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who having received in his boſome, and into his mouth, the laſt groans of his father, caſt himſelf on his body, and whilſt he watered his face with tears, procur'd Phyſicians to imbalm him accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the cuſtome of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who ſpent ſeaventy dayes in mourning for <hi>Jacob.</hi> After which <hi>Joſeph</hi> ask'd and obtain'd leave of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to conduct him unto the Monument he had bought in <hi>Canaan,</hi> to which he was followed by the old men of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and by all the moſt antient Officers of the kings houſe.

               <p>In fine, they all ariv'd at a ſpatious place which was beyond <hi>Jordan,</hi> which the <hi>Hebrews</hi> called <hi>Atad,</hi> by reaſon it was covered all over with Thorns, and which now bears the name of <hi>Betagla,</hi> which is as much to ſay, the lodging of the circle, becauſe the Children of <hi>Jacob</hi> ſet themſelves there in order to perform the Ceremonies of the funerall, and to deplore the loſſe of their father with the greateſt demonſtration of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, all which was performed in the court of <hi>Atad,</hi> and in this houſe of tears, for the ſpace of ſeaven intire dayes. Afterwards <hi>Joſeph</hi> with his brethren, and all the reſt of the Convoy, return'd into <hi>Egypt,</hi> to ſettle themſelves in their uſuall employments.

To this effect they choſe one amongſt them, who ſhould goe unto <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and whoſe Commiſſion was to inform him, that <hi>Jacob</hi> their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Father of happy memory had commanded them at his death to tell him, that he deſired him to forget what was paſt, and they all conjur'd him in his name to grant this favour.</p>
               <p>Which <hi>Joſeph</hi> hearing, he began to weep, and his tears ſerv'd to aſſure his Brethren, who caſt themſelves at his feet, taking at the ſame time the boldneſs of their own accord to demand that Pardon from him, which they had already ſolicited by the means of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> or ſome other, who they believed would be more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to him; adding beſides, that they were all his Servants, and reſolved to live and dy in that quality: To which <hi>Joſeph</hi> anſwered, that they need not fear any thing, that he would take care of them, and of all their Children, and for the reſt he would not be leſs pittifull towards them than God, whoſe example he follow'd, and who had changed all their evill purpoſes into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable occaſions to procure his good, having alſo rar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, as it were, on a Throne of honour, and power, by the ſame Arms they had uſed to precipitate him into an Abyſs of miſeries and calamities.</p>
               <p>Behold the ſenſe of a noble Soul, and of a generous courage, whoſe tears did not reſemble thoſe of Croca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diles, nor ſuch kindneſses as are uſed by Apes which ſtrangle in flattering, and in ſhedding feign'd tears.</p>
               <p>Revenge is only proper unto weak minds, whereas Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency reſides alwayes in a ſtrong ſpirit.

It was God who put Arms into his hands, and this brave Courage feared no danger in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking a quarrell in which God, Nature, and Reaſon ingaged him. This Zeal was neither raſh, furious, nor intereſſed, but prudent, and grounded upon reaſon, and the publick good: It was an Act of Juſtice by which he began to exerciſe the honourable office of a Judge, and Regent over the people of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

               <p>THE office of a Shepheard was antiently a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble imployment.
<note place="margin">The Apprentiſhip of Empires.</note> And <hi>Philo</hi> who hath been one of the moſt faithfull Hiſtorians of the firſt ages, called it in expreſſe termes the prelude to an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, that is to ſay, to the government of men, which ought to be the moſt humane and moſt amiable of all others. This moſt wiſe and learned Authour paſſed much further: for he believ'd that perſon could be only perfect in the art of ruling, who was a good Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, and who governing flocks whoſe conduct is moſt facil, had learnt how a man muſt behave himſelf in commanding thoſe whoſe government is more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult and important.</p>
               <p>It was then for this cauſe the firſt men of the world,
<note place="margin">The firſt ſhepheards of the world.</note> and the moſt illuſtrious perſons of the old Teſtament had this innocent imployment, as if God would have them paſſe this apprentiſhip, to render them capable of ruling this people, for whom he had a particular care.</p>
               <p>It was alſo for the moſt part in theſe imployments which have leſs of Pomp and ſplendour than ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and repoſe, that God who delightes in humility and peace, hath choſen humble and peaceable ſouls to give himſelf unto them, and make them both ſee and feel that it was his hand which had guided them in the fields and out of the noiſe and tumults, to the end their minds might be better prepared to hear and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the laws and precepts which he intended to give them, and that the night and obſcurity of a Country

               <p>So when <hi>Moſes</hi> went guiding the ſheep of <hi>Iethro,</hi> who was his father-in-Law, one day as he was in the thickeſt part of the deſart, whether the feeding were better, or whether, as it is more probable, he had a deſire to attend more ſweetly to contemplation; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at length reached the top of Mount <hi>Sina</hi> called <hi>Horeb,</hi> he ſaw God in a fiery Buſh, which nevertheleſſe was not conſumed in the midſt of the flames.</p>
               <p>This was no illuſion of the Underſtanding,
<note place="margin">The verity of the Buſh.</note> the figure of a dream, nor any phantaſticall image which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to <hi>Moſes;</hi> But the ſecond Perſon of the moſt holy Trinity, or at leaſt ſome Angell who repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him.</p>
               <p>This fire likewiſe was a true and real fire, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by a Divine breathing, and by an Angelicall hand, which without breaking the Laws of Nature was able to draw this fire either out of Wood, the Air, or thoſe ſtones which were about this ſacred Buſh. The reſpect nevertheleſſe the fire bore unto a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which it never ſpares, was not naturall, there requir'd a Miracle to ſtay the courſe of its activity; and the rigour of thoſe flames which iſſued forth of the earth had not left this Wood unconſum'd, if He whoſe leaſt glance inlightens the ſtars in the heavens, &amp; without whom the Sun &amp; Moon would remain in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, had not ſuſpended for a while this active conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and theſe fertile and powerfull influences, without which creatures have neither life, motion, nor action.</p>

It being ſo, this Enigma can have no other literal ſenſe than this.</p>
               <p>This fire is the Image of God, and the flaming Buſh a figure of the Iſraelites, whom theſe Divine flames kept in a gentle heat, where like gold in the Furnace, they might be purified, but not conſum'd.</p>
               <p>They that will otherwiſe explicate this Picture, may ſay, that this is.

               <p>Others, with <hi>Rupertus, Theodoret,</hi> and St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> will believe, that it was a figure of the bleſſed Virgin, whoſe Chaſtity, as a fiery buſh, could not be violated, although ſhe had brought forth him, who is nothing but Splendour, Fire, Light and Ardour.

                  </note> Lord, ſaith he, why doſt thou permit the oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thy people?

After this loving complaint, God diſcovered himſelf fully unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> to give him a more aſſured mark of his love.

               <p>This impudent perſon is never aſhamed even in the moſt infamous Actions; all dangers which make others tremble, render him more bold; and his inſolence paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth yet farther: for he is timerarious even in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns God, and hath no more fear of him, than reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence towards men: whence it proceeds, that he would never ceaſe to ſin, if he did not firſt ceaſe to live, and theſe terrors would never end, if Death did not ſet ſome bounds thereunto.

               <p>
                  <hi>My God! give me then rather the heart of a Tyger, than ſo hard a heart, to the end if I cannot love thee with the heart of a man, I may take revenge on my ſelf, with the heart of a beaſt, and make my heart the prey of my liberality; But if thy goodneſs cannot endure ſuch a butchery, give me, O God, of my heart, a heart the moſt loving that ever was: Then will I immolate it to thee, and thou ſhalt be the Maſter of it for all eternity. At this inſtant then I Sacrifice my pureſt affections to thee; At this inſtant I will obey thy commands, and break for this cauſe with all creatures. This is to provoke, too long, the wrath of a Judge, to irritate the clemency of a Father, and to heap together a train of miſeries, a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of anger and indignation. We muſt not then expect till the meaſure be full, till we be in the bottome of the Abyſſe, and covered with the dreadfull obſcurities of night, in which the torches of Love are extinguiſhed, and the Lights of hope eternally put out.

               <p>Whence I conclude,
<note place="margin">Marciline Ficinus in Epidem.</note> with one of the moſt learned Phyſicians, and moſt ſubtile Philoſophers which hath ever been, That the particular cauſes of this diſeaſe are commonly, either the Defections of the Planets, and eſpecially of the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> or their Conjunctions, as of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> or the Malignant Impreſſions of Comets and certain Meteors, which pervert the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the Air, and which by the ſequel of ſome over hot, and moiſt Winds, or elſe by immoderate Rains, or from ſome other effects, of which they are the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,

               <p>Moreover, this Contagion may grow from too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and too immoderate exceſſes, in ſleep or watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in repoſe or exerciſe, feaſting or abſtinence, but chiefly from diſorder, which begets in the Humors of the Body, the Paſſions of the Minde, amongſt which Love is a Wilde-fire and Brand of Hell, which inkindles a thouſand Inflammations, a thouſand Coals, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Plagues.</p>
               <p>In fine,

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:157758:154"/>as that Prince, who after he had ſought out all wayes to terrifie his people, who had taken up armes againſt him, reſolv'd at laſt to have one great Skeleton car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in triumph, which held a Hand of Juſtice and a Sith, after which, and the ſounding of Trumpets, an Herauld was ſo clothed in black and covered with a large cipres veil wrought with Thunderbolts and crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned darts who proclamed that this Queen was unpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, and that ſhe intended ſpeedily to make a horrid Sepulchre of a great kingdome.</p>
               <p>But this funerall pomp was not fully ended, when the moſt mutinous and moſt ſeditious appear'd, who ask'd pardon, and eſteemed themſelves more happy to fall into the hands of a king who might chaſtiſe them without depriving them of life, than of a Queen who cannot puniſh but with death. It was, I beleeve, for the ſame reaſon <hi>Togaris</hi> the Phyſician of <hi>Leon</hi> the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian</hi> cured all the maladies and pains which exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not unto the diſſolution of the body and ſoul. In effect, there is nothing ſo terrible and dreadfull as death, and God himſelf hath never erected more tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick Theaters than when he would cauſe this cruell Tyrant to march, which makes all the Cataſtrophes of life, and after many combats and actions at laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes creatures without any poſſibility of their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing the place or moment of their deſtruction.</p>

               <p>Methinks I hear the Herauld already pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the ſentence, and condemning the firſt-born of <hi>Egypt</hi> unto death: It is <hi>Moſes</hi> who ſpeaks, or rather our Lord by his mouth; For he is but the Eccho of his voice, and the inſtrument of his moſt holy and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt decrees.</p>

True Wiſdom conſiſts in rendring our ſelves ſo plain unto his commands, that we muſt never ſo much as provoke his mildeſt Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances; otherwiſe we ſhall ſee our ſelves at laſt aſſaulted by all ſorts of enemies.

It was on the fourteenth day of the Moneth, which they called <hi>Niſan,</hi> when the Moon was directly oppoſit to the Sun, and equally ſhared with him the Empire which they poſſeſs in the Heavens, that they celebrated this admirable Sacrifice, which was one of the moſt expreſs and lively Figures of that which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> preſented unto his Father upon the Tree of the Croſs.</p>

               <p>Firſt, God had commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> to publiſh unto all his people, That on the tenth day of the Moon, of the firſt Moneth, every Family ſhould have a Lamb in his houſe, and that four days after it was to be Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed without breaking any part of his bones.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It was to be a Male, and not a Female.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It was to be but a year old.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It was to be without blemiſh or defect.</p>
               <p>Afterwards, the Threſholds of the Doors and Houſes where this Feaſt had been kept, were to be dyed with his blood. It was alſo ordained, That this Lamb ſhould be eaten, neither Boiled, nor Raw, but onely Roſted with Unlevened Bread, and with Wilde Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, in ſuch ſort, as neither Feet, Entrails, nor Head muſt remain, at leaſt, if any were left, it was to be thrown into the fire.</p>
               <pb n="300" facs="tcp:157758:157"/>
               <p>Concerning the Ceremony which they obliged to obſerve at this Feaſt,
<note place="margin">

                  </note> They all ought to be in a poſture of taking a journey at their riſing from the Table, and like Travellers to have their Reins girt, ſhooes on their Feet, and Staves in their Hands.</p>
               <p>The Law alſo enjoyned this repaſt to be made in haſte, and that every one ſhould be careful to keep the blood of this Lamb, to mark the place where he lived; to the end, when God ſhould paſs about midnight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their doors, to deſtroy all the firſt-born of <hi>Egypt;</hi> ſeeing this blood, he might paſs further, and be touched with Compaſſion for the Afflictions of his people.</p>
               <p>But to what purpoſe were theſe marks, and this blood upon the doors? What! Can there be any thing hidden from him, who beholds in his Word; and in himſelf all that is, ſhall be, and hath ever been?</p>
               <p>This was then but a Sign,
<note place="margin">Repreſentions of the Lamb.</note> and an Image by which the Eternal Father was pleaſed to manifeſt, That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhould be marked with the precious blood of this Lamb, ought not to apprehend any danger. And truly, if the blood of Bulls and Goats, and if the Aſhes of a Red Heifer, which were caſt upon thoſe who had contracted ſome uncleanneſs, had the power to abſolve offenders, at leaſt before the eyes of men, and if they put them in a condition to partake of the common Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices with others; with how much ſtronger reaſon ought the Blood of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who is the ſame Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and hath been ſacrificed for ſinners upon the Altar of Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> after he had given his Body for food, and his Blood for drink, to be more efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for cleanſing our ſouls from all ſorts of impurities. It is for this, he hath acquired the title of the <hi>Mediator</hi> of the New Teſtament; and in like maner, where the Old Law was confirmed by Ceremonies of Blood, it was onely to prefigure what was to be done in the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the New.

<pb n="301" facs="tcp:157758:157"/>and Sacrifice of the Paſchal Lamb, the Sacred Myſtery of the Paſſion, and the Adorable Sacrament of the moſt Holy Euchariſt, in which the Lamb was maſculine and yong; that is to ſay, Conſtant and generous, though tender and delicate.

Behold an entry into the Feaſt of the Supper, where he ought to be taken with a pure Conſcience, and a mouth which hath been purified by bitter Lettices; that is to ſay, With dolourous tears, and waters diſtilled by the hand of pennance. It is there where we ought to gird our Reins; for otherwiſe a God of Purity would abhor to enter into an unclean Habitation, into an unchaſte Soul, and into a Body which ſerves for a retreat unto the moſt mercileſs enemies of Vertue and Chaſtity.</p>
               <p>We muſt have Staves in our Hands, and Shooes on our Feet like Pilgrims, which paſs along and ſeek an abode elſwhere, than in a forrein Country, where we muſt quit all we have, or elſe either ſoon or late, be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken by them.</p>
               <p>Let us make haſte then, and remember,
<note place="margin">An excellent thought.</note> I beſeech you, that this very day may be our Paſchal, and our paſſage from Earth unto Heaven. What ſtayes us in the World? our Parents will paſs away, or elſe are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready gone before.</p>
               <p>Our Friends are not here beneath; for the Earth hath none but infidel, perfidious, and envious people.
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:157758:158"/>In fine, All that is under Heaven remains in a continual viciſſitude: The face of the Univerſe changeth every moment, and that which ſparkleth the moſt, hath but marks of a vain appearance, which ſerve onely to dazle our eyes, and deceive our ſouls.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Such then,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, as have wives, ought to live as if they had none;</hi> that is to ſay, Without being faſtned unto any inordinate affection.

               <p>This concludes, my Brethren, That we muſt break the Chains which faſten us to any other thing than God; we muſt abandon <hi>Egypt,</hi> and depart out of this unfortunate Land, where nothing but Plagues, Deaths, and all ſorts of horrors are ſeen.</p>
               <p>Happy are they who follow God and <hi>Moſes</hi> in the thickeſt part of the deſart, out of theſe tumults and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,

               <p>I leave you, my dear Reader, to reflect on all that paſſed in this illuſtrious Departure, and during this voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age which was, I believe, the moſt famous that hath ever been.</p>

<pb n="310" facs="tcp:157758:161"/>which left them only ſome glimmering to follow their enemies, whom nevertheleſs they could not diſcern.

This was an admirable proſpect, and a ſpectacle worthy the eyes and hand of Almighty God.

               <p>I might often borrow ſome Harmonies from ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny choiſe ſpirits which every day cauſe that antient Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick to reſound in the heart of <hi>France,</hi> which was firſt ſung upon the Mountains of <hi>Sion,</hi> and in the holy Land:

For this end he hath rais'd the Heavens, the Air, and the Stars over our heads, as ſo many treaſuries, in which he hath encloſed the light and vitall influences, without which the world would be but a confus'd Maſs, and a dreadfull Tomb. He hath alſo peopled the elements, and given to every one what was convenient and neceſſary for their infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.

It ſeems alſo that he was, as it were, obliged thereunto, and that if by ſome ſecret of his wiſe Providence he chance to withdraw his arm and hand, which fills us with all ſorts of benedictions, we may have ſome cauſe to complain and murmur againſt him.

<pb n="324" facs="tcp:157758:169"/>of the world, and of the Church.</p>
               <p>It was an Antepaſt of the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hidden under this adorable bread, whoſe ſpecies hath a particular reſemblance with the Manna, and a more excellent ſweetneſs than that of this bread of the deſart. It muſt not alſo be taken untill we have abandoned the carnal alurements of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the deceiptfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of the world, and ſin: This is the food preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the hand of Magnificence, and received by thoſe of faith; Whence it comes, that covetous and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving people find there nothing but wormes and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction.</p>
               <p>It is alſo a fruit, and there is no need either of culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating the Earth, or ſowing any graines or ſeedes to gather it; But without humane labour it comes out of the boſome of God its Father, and out of the Bowels of the Virgin, and amidſt the influences and dewes of the holy Ghoſt, on a Table where ſouls meet with their moſt pleaſing repaſt.</p>
               <p>It is little, and incloſed under ſmall appearances of bread. The people are aſtoniſhed at it, they ask in this great aſtoniſhment, what it is, and how that could be done which was told them, and what they were to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve concerning it.

There ſhall we drink large draughts of it, in the torrents of delight, and in ſtead of the dew of Manna we ſhall be ſatiated in an Ocean of Nectar and Ambroſia, that is without boundes, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, limit, or bottome.</p>
               <p>Ah! I think the time long till we be out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and free from theſe chaines which linck us to ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:157758:169"/>ſervices, and ſo unworthy of a Soul ranſomed by the blood and life of a God. Alas! When will this ſo much deſired moment come? When ſhall we hear the Canti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of victory, and when ſhall we goe amongſt the daughtes of <hi>Sion,</hi> to our Country, crying out with a loud voice, that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> is ſwallowed up under the Abyſſes, and that all thoſe troops of Enemies which purſue, us have ſuffered a diſmal ſhipwrack, not onely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the waves of the Red Sea, but under the lakes of fire, Sulphur, blood, and Malediction.</p>
               <p>Mean while let us content our ſelves with the real Manna, whereof our forefathers have had but the Figure. Let us goe unto the Sanctuary, where it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited for us and our generations. Let us eat this bread of Angels, and let us drink of this wine, which germinats virgins, Let us make uſe of it according to the Lawes which are preſcrib'd us.

               <p>Above all, ſince this bread of Heaven hath all ſorts of Savours, let us not mix with it any earthly food, or any of all thoſe meates, which the Fleſh, the World, and Hell uſe to ſeaſon; for this were to mingle reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies with poiſon, and convert a Feaſt of life into a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt of death; and it had been much better for them to have remained amongſt the Fleſh-pots, and onyons of <hi>Egypt,</hi> or at leaſt to have dyed of famine in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart, than to have immolated themſelves at the foot of an Altar and Sanctuary as a victime of terror, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiouſneſs, and Execration.</p>

               <p>It is our profeſſion, our Imployment, and one of our moſt uſual exerciſes, to be in this conflict, and we muſt neceſſarily always attacque or defend. And often to repulſe an aſſault were to be a Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in this kind of war, and though ſometimes we be almoſt vanquiſhed, yet we may have the glory of triumphing, provided we hold out to the laſt: the reaſon of this is moſt evident, for as much as the aſſailer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afterwards wholy conſtrained to make a diſhono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable retreat, he that hath been ſo couragious, as ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ward all his blowes, and to ſmile at his threats, remains like a fortreſs and ſtrong hold which after a long ſiedge ſees at laſt the rout of thoſe who had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted it, and where, if the Gates, out-works, Bulwarks and walls had mouths, they would be heard to cry out victory, and all theſe breaches would ſerve onely to ſay, that even the defences have overcome.</p>
               <p>Now that which cauſeth many to yeeld at the firſt approaches, is the little courage they have to reſiſt, or an over-great confidence in their own forces, imagining that they can doe what is impoſſible for them, and that it is eaſy long to preſerve a place whereof God is not the Govenour. There are alſo ſome who are affrighted at the firſt difficulty, and preſently deſpair, as if God were not gratious enough to help them, and powerfull enough to furniſh them with what they need. His mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent hand hath been pleaſed to doe us all the good we

               <p>What ingratitude and what cruelty!

               <p>I Know not who ſaid that men were as the arms of God; It is true that they are not onely the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his mercy, but alſo the arms of his indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Theſe are ſometimes darts which he caſts the one againſt the other, Billowes which mutiny and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce fluxes and refluxes to ſwallow up each other in a common Shipwrack, and flames which faſten on a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſubject to make there a funeſtous Pile, in which they uſually invelop themſelves even in the ſame fire. It is allmoſt impoſſible that the World can ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a perfect peace, ſo long as there ſhall be men; for peace it ſelf is very often the mother of warr; repoſe which gives truce unto the ſoul raiſeth in it a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand thoughts and paſſions, which arm themſelves at the beating of the firſt Alarm, and advance into the field upon the firſt occaſion. God himſelf marcheth in the head of battalions, and I know not whether it be not for this cauſe, he Calls himſelf the great God of Hoſtes, well doe I know, that he always preſides there, making uſe of them to reward ſome and to puniſh o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:157758:172"/>and to the end we may take notice, that war is one of his ſcourges, and that there be always inviſible weapons reſembling ſo many torches which he lights and extinguiſheth according to his good pleaſure: In fine, it is a moſt infallible verity, that victory in war, though wavering and inconſtant in its own nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in the hand of God, and it is a Bird which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take its flight, but to that part which is aſſign'd it by his moſt holy Providence.</p>
               <p>The Iſraelites had a powerfull motive to know this verity, in the firſt war they were enforced to maintain againſt the Amalekites after their paſſage over the Red Sea.

               <p>This was the motive of their taking up arms, beſides their fear ſeeing this great multitude led by <hi>Moſes,</hi> who marched towards the Land of Promiſe, as if the happy moment were come, in which the Benediction, which <hi>Jacob</hi> had in a manner forced from <hi>Eſau,</hi> was to be accompliſhed.</p>
               <p>Methinks when I caſt my eyes upon theſe mutinous troops, which forraged the Country, and purſu'd the Hebrews with ſo much fury and animoſity, I ſee an army of hobgoblins, which are commonly called the inciters of Fleſh and Blood, which have no ſooner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a ſoul out of the Lands of <hi>Egypt</hi> and out of the empire of carnall and mundane pleaſures, but they preſently take the field to aſſault her, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb her entry into the happy Land, which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed her, and into ſome holy retreat.</p>
               <p>But we muſt fear nothing, ſince we need but lift up our hands to Heaven like <hi>Moſes,</hi> and implore the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of that great Intelligence, who never abandons thoſe who are inroled under his Standard, and fight

<note place="margin">The efficacy of prayer.</note> what victory! Kings, Captains, Soldiers, entire Legions are defeated by the ejaculations, ſighs, and prayers of one ſingle man; what efficacy of Prayer!

Prayer is not only, as St. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi> ſaith, the monument and Sepulcher of dying men, the Sanctuary of the Afflicted, the Advocate of Criminals, the Seal and Character of purity, the Nurſe of temperance, the Bridle of impatience, the Conſerver of peace, but the Standard alſo of War, and the Soul of all our triumphs; who will wonder then, if the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malekites</hi> be defeated, ſince <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was the moſt devout, ardent, zealous and holy Man upon Earth, made his moſt humble ſupplications unto God for this purpoſe?

               <p>In truth, it is a very reaſonable thing to bear reſpect and love, to ſuccour and obey thoſe to whom, next unto God, we owe our lives; and we muſt be more inſenſible and more unnaturall than beaſts, to refuſe theſe affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate duties to our Parents, and to thoſe whom we ought to eſteem as Fathers, Mothers, and Superiours, ſuch as heaven hath plac'd over our heads to rule and govern us, either concerning temporall or ſpirituall matters. We muſt baniſh then out of the world, and out of Families, all thoſe little Dragons and domeſtick Vipers which have neither teeth, claws, gall, nor poiſon, but to tear the heart and bowels in which they have been formed and conceived, and to deſtroy thoſe of whom they hold their lives. All houſes ought to be Temples conſecrated unto love and pietie, as that which was built at <hi>Rome</hi> in lieu of a Priſon, where a young Lady had nouriſhed her Mother with her own Milk, ſeeing the Gaolers hindred her from carrying any food to her. O holy piety! where are now theſe Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Altars? where doe we ſee ſuch Daughters give ſuck unto their Mothers, as this gallant Roman did? or Fathers to have Daughters like this other of whom <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> makes mention,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Valer. Max. lib.</hi> 5.</note> who found out the means to nouriſh her Father in the ſame manner, and had the honour to be the Mother of her Father, who ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred his laſt ſighs in her boſome, ſucking a drop of Milk from her breaſt? Moreover, if I am not deceived, can there be found more Daughters than Sons, who work the like Miracles? their Sex is more inclinable to
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:157758:181"/>ſweetneſs and piety, and to thoſe amiable tenderneſſes which reach even to the higheſt pitch of generoſity. There have been heretofore Men, who deſiring to ſuffer death for their Fathers, have rendred themſelves im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall. Such a one was that Lock-ſmith of <hi>Toledo,</hi> who expoſed himſelf unto the extremeſt tortures to free his Father, and to obtain his life, with his pardon. But the example of <hi>Alexius,</hi> Son to the Emperour <hi>Iſaack,</hi> is more illuſtrious, who in the midſt of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations of <hi>Greece,</hi> which ſaluted him King, had no ears, but to hear the plaints of his Father, no eyes, but to behold his miſeries, and no power, but to replace him on his Throne, and in the Empire, whereof his Brother had deprived him.</p>
               <p>It is not then againſt this young Prince, nor againſt his like, that <hi>Sina</hi> will ſhoot poiſonous Darts, and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Arrows, as againſt Paricides, but on the contrary, after a long ſequel of years, they ſhall have lived in this world, the courſe of their glory will not find its period, but in Eternity, which can never have an end.</p>

<pb n="349" facs="tcp:157758:181"/>body and life of our Neighbour. It is alſo a Sentence of death pronounced by the mouth of God againſt all thoſe who are cauſers of other mens deaths, and make no more account of a mans life than of a flye. I would gladly know whether they find in the Decalogue a Challenge, an aſſaſſination, and all thoſe violences which are practiſed upon a man, as upon a beaſt. I would willingly ſee them making their randezvous and aſſignations upon Mount <hi>Sina,</hi> where they ſhall behold a God thundring and lightning over their heads; but it would be more gratefull unto me to ſee them perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an honourable penance in this life, and ſatisfying Juſtice and Piety before their deaths, than afterwards to expect an Eternity of puniſhments and ſeverities.</p>

               <p>I have ſeen certain antient aenigmaes, where the tongue was painted on a Throne in the form of a Queen, who carryed life and death in her Hand. In effect, there needs but a good word to ſave the lives of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Innocents, and a bad one to render them all cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable. War, Plague, Famine, and the ſcourges of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth have never committed ſo many Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and given ſo many wounds as this little miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous two-edged Knife. It is this Murthering blade with which Brothers and Siſters cut one anothers Throats. The Mouth of a Lyar, of an Hypocrite, of an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, of a Backbiter, of a Falſe witneſs, of a Flatterer, of a Traitor, and a Calumniator, was for this reaſon moſt juſtly called an Arcenal, out of which all the arms of death, and all the inſtruments of miſery are taken. It is alſo a fatall ſource out of which iſſue a thouſand poyſonous ſtreams, which flow as well over Cities as Villages: The whole World is ſubject unto theſe cruel inundations, which raiſe tempeſts in the midſt of Hearts, and drown the moſt holy amities. There are alſo dead waters, which are ſometime more dangerous than the moſt impetuous torrents and the moſt Rapid Rivers. There are ſome who ſcoff, play the buffoons, and bite when they ſmile. We ought to fear nothing ſo much as thoſe remedies of Empericks, which have a ſugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

               <p>Some there are who imagin that it is ſufficient to have a vermillion colour upon their Cheeks, and for the reſt it little imports what they have upon their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Theſe are Sepulchers outwardly white and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:157758:183"/>inwardly eaten with Worms; fair and clear waters, but impoiſoned; bodyes cloathed in Sattin and Velvet, but eaten with Cankers and ordures. And ſuch are thoſe who figure to themſelves that it is enough for them to put no man to death, and not publickly to raviſh Maids, to make a prey of their lubricity, but otherwiſe that it is lawfull to bear a cut throat in their hearts, and to make their ſouls a retreat for all ſorts of impurity, where like ſo many Harpees they devour at leaſt by their unjuſt deſires all that their eyes behold. Theſe are ſtrange Maximes, whereof the Devils themſelves have been the firſt Authors: but it is a brutiſh Ignorance, and a ſtupid blindneſs not to diſcern, that both good and evill proceeds from the heart, and that our deſires are like ſo many Weſtern gales, which may cauſe fair dayes; and as many Northern Winds which occaſion foul and ſtormy weather. But a worldly and libertine ſoul will tell me, that there is much trouble in it, and that we muſt be blind, deaf, dumb, and leprous, not to feel the wounds of thoſe darts which paſſe ſuddenly through our ſenſes; and I will anſwer her, that we muſt be Turks and no Chriſtians to give up our ſelves for a prey, and for a mark unto all the ſhafts, which the World, Fleſh, and Hell uſe to ſhoot at us. But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that it is very difficult never to be ſurpriſed; yet it is ſufficient,</p>
               <p>Firſt, if it be poſſible never to give the leaſt occaſion thereunto.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to avoid dangers, namely, when they are diſcovered.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we muſt often replace in our minds a Hell, a death, a life, and a <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who dyed onely to preſerve us from them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we muſt alwayes remain in a diffidence of our ſelves, and place all our hopes on God.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, we muſt have alwayes arms in our hands not to be ſurprized by this roaring Lion,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:157758:184"/>who both day and night walks round about us.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, the prize we expect, and the victory which ſhall crown our Combats, is no mean conſolation.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, we muſt play the Philoſophers, ſtudying the qualities of our deſires and temptations, to the end, having diſcovered the Nature of the diſeaſe, we may apply ſuch remedies as are proper for it.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, we muſt withdraw our ſelves from objects: For theſe are lights, which dazle neer at hand, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far off have ſcarce any luſter at all.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, we muſt dry up the ſpring of our deſires and concupiſcences, mortifying our bodyes, and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing our ſouls to ſuch a condition, as we might deſire no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is good and honeſt.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, we may ſometime diſcover the error of our deſires and fancies, and contemplate that with horror, which we deſire with ſo much paſſion; And we ſhall perceive as well as <hi>Raymundus Lullius,</hi> that all is but a Canker, an Ulcer, an infectious and ſtinking dunghill covered over with a bit of Taffaty, or ſome ſmall piece of fine Holland.

Behold, ſaith Saint <hi>John Chryſoſtom,</hi> the Antiperiſtaſis of perfect Charity, wherein all hearts which have any charge of ſouls, ought to finde the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of their moſt holy and juſt ardors. And this is what <hi>Moſes</hi> did in the midſt of the contempts, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions of all his people, for whom, when he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſome eaſment of pain, and ſome diminution of the puniſhments they had deſerved, he deſcended from the Mountain, carrying between his arms the Tables, in which the Law was written on both ſides, which he thought not yet convenient to give unto ſuch unworthy people and polluted with the moſt heinous of all Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges; but having broken them in peeces, he went di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to caſt down the Golden Calve, and diſſolve it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to duſt, which he afterward threw into the ſtream of a torrent, which iſſued forth of Mount <hi>Sina,</hi> and paſſed
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:157758:188"/>through the midſt of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> Camp; to the end, they might ſwallow down theſe funeſtous Reliques, and that no man might ever behold them without horror.</p>
               <p>Afterwards he blamed <hi>Aaron</hi> as the Author of this crime, who endeavored to excuſe himſelf, relating to him in order what had paſſed, the which did not yet divert <hi>Moſes</hi> from doing what his zeal inſpired him: For, from thence he came to the entrance of the Camp, where making a ſtand, he cryed out, that all that were of Gods party, and had not participated of Idolatry, ſhould follow him, which the Children of <hi>Levi</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whoſe Tribe had continued moſt faithful unto God, put themſelves in a ring about <hi>Moſes,</hi> who following the Sovereign Power of Life and Death, which he had received from God, commanded them to betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their Arms, and lay about them, without ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any of the guilty, either Brother, Friend, Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, or any perſon amongſt theſe impious men; ſo that the number of the dead amounted to three and twenty thouſand.</p>
               <p>Behold, a ſtrange maſſacre; nevertheleſs, it is an effect of meekneſs which hath changed its countenance, and taken that of ſeverity. Theſe are ſhafts which iſſued out of a heart, the fulleſt of Pity and Clemency which was then in the world, but ſhot by the hand of Juſtice. If ſuch as govern Republicks and States, had nothing but Crowns to recompence their merits,

A Prince ought to have the meekneſs of a Lamb, and the terror of a Lyon, otherwiſe men abuſe him, and his power ſeems but for a ſupport unto the blackeſt diſſolutions. The people alſo ought to love with fear, otherwiſe their love degenerates into contempt.</p>

               <p>I know that Thrones have no foundation more ſolid and immovable, than when they are ſupported by the hearts of their Subjects; but if Guards be not placed about them, as ſo many Pillars, there needs but one ſtorm to overthrow them.</p>
               <p>It cannot be doubted, but this kinde of mixture is full of difficulty: but as a body is never in perfect health, but when all its four humors are in an equal tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; ſo Kingdoms are never better governed, than when they equally uſe meekneſs and ſeverity.</p>
               <p>Choler is the touchſtone of Virtue,
<note place="margin">Rigorous Meekneſs.</note> and that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hath no ſoul, who cannot be irritated when occaſion is given.

<pb n="364" facs="tcp:157758:189"/>defend every Levite. Behold, an army of Stags led by a Lyon, which is more dreadful than an army of Lyons conducted by a Stag. So <hi>Aaron</hi> was but a timorous Stag, when he gave way unto the murmurings of the people; and <hi>Moſes</hi> a generous Lyon, when he himſelf plunged his Sword into the boſom of Rebellion and Impiety. It is much eaſier to finde Soldiers, than a brave Captain:

               <p>I Know not from whence the Romans, and the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtals had the fire which they ſo charily preſerved in their Temple; but that which the Iſraelites kept in the Tabernacle was a preſent they received from Heaven eight dayes after <hi>Moſes</hi> had Conſecrated <hi>Aaron,</hi> and enjoyned him to offer his firſt Sacrifices: This was in teſtimony that God approved them, and to imprint deeper in the minds of the people, the honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence they were to bear unto their High-Prieſts, and to theſe publick acts of their Religion. Afterwards the Gentiles endevoured to diſturb theſe Myſteries, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſought to make us believe, that their Gods kept amorous Thunderbolts, &amp; Sacred flames for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:157758:195"/>of their Religion; and for this purpoſe they had given names unto ſome, as a mark of the favors they had received from them, in their Sacrifices, which as they gave out, had been often inkindled by their hands.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, theſe are but Fables, and Impiety and Sacrileges afforded no coals of the Sanctuary, nor any flames of Heaven, like thoſe which fired the Holo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſts, and Victims of <hi>Aaron,</hi> in the preſence of the people, who did partake of the Sacrifice,

               <p>Secondly, That they could not be quenched, even in water.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That they were to be kept in a Purple Cloath.</p>
               <p>But their imagination had more reſembled truth,
<note place="margin">Fair Analogies of fire with God.</note> if inſtead of amuſing themſelves on theſe dreams, they had ſaid, That this was the moſt ordinary Figure, by which God uſeth to erect a Throne of Light and Ardor unto his Love, which is but a moſt pure fire, without mixture, which deſcended from Heaven upon Earth, to cauſe a general inflagration in all hearts; which to ſpeak properly, ought to be no other than the Altars of the moſt illuſtrious Sacrifices of Love, Faith, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; concerning which, God hath been pleaſed to give marks and ſigns of his particular preſence, cauſing himſelf to be ſeen and felt under the form of Fire, which of Natural bodies, reſembleth him the moſt: So
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:157758:196"/>that <hi>Moſes</hi> durſt ſay unto his people,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 21.</note> That his God was a conſuming Fire.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, becauſe this Element hath more reſemblance with its Creator, in regard of the power and command it hath received beyond others.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe, as there is nothing more amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and terrible than fire; ſo there is nothing which equals the goodneſs God expreſſeth to the vertuous, and the chaſtiſement he implores to take revenge on the wicked.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is the nature of fire, as well as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of God, to enlighten the night, to melt Ice, to warm thoſe that approach it, and to burn ſuch as will touch it. Moreover, it is the property of them both inceſſantly and vigorouſly to act, and to communicate themſelves without loſs or alteration, to be moſt pure, ſimple, and ſubtile, to harden and mollifie ſubſtances, and always to aſcend.</p>
               <p>In fine, the wiſdom of God breaks forth in the midſt of ſparkling fires, his goodneſs in its ardors, and his power (to which all is poſſible), in thoſe flames which God cannot reſiſt: And as heat and light ſpring from fire, ſo the Son and the Holy Ghoſt are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from the Father, as from their Beginning and Origin.</p>
               <p>It is not then without reaſon, God takes veils of fire to cover his Majeſty, and that he often appears under this ſhape in Sacrifices; ſince theſe fires are kindled by his own hand, and by the torch of his Love, unto which we muſt approach with the ſame reverence, as to the buſh of <hi>Moſes;</hi>

               <p>Ah! ſaid they, we have too long wandred in this ſolitary place, ſometimes upon Mountains, and then in Valleys; nevertheleſs, after a journey of forty years, we have not hitherto reached the Haven; And even this Manna which fell from Heaven, and which indeed, hath hitherto ſupplied our moſt preſſing neceſſities, is yet but a very ſlight nouriſhment, and which affords more diſtaſte than benefit: Why did we then leave <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi>

<pb n="384" facs="tcp:157758:199"/>more conformable to the diſeaſe, and that ſuch as had been puniſhed by Serpents, after they had vomitted all the venome out of their ſerpentine mouths, might have at leaſt this counter-poiſon, which was, as it were, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed within this miraculous Serpent. Now all this was but a moſt lively figure of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> faſtned on the Croſs, who bore all the moſt bloody marks, and the moſt ſhameful appearances of a ſinner; although he were Purity and Innocency it ſelf, which can receive no ſtain of ſin.</p>
               <p>The Braſs whereof the Serpent was formed, and which amongſt all other Metals hath I know not what more ſolid qualities, and leſs ſubject unto corruption, denoted nothing elſe but the Divinity of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and his Eternity.</p>
               <p>We may alſo obſerve with Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> upon this Figure, ſome marks of the reſplendency and glory of the Croſs, which carried its light and ſplendor even unto the ſhadows of Gentiliſm and Idolatry, where its Trophies and Power have appeared, notwithſtanding the rage and fury of the moſt dreadful Tyrants.</p>
               <p>In fine, if this Brazen Serpent bore certain colours of fire, who ſees not that it was a very evident token of Love and Charity, which paſſed even into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of a Father to ſeek a Son, and into the flames of a Sanctuary to ſeek a God, to convert him into a man of Fire, which deſcended not on Earth, but to inflame him with the amorous ardors of his infinite Charity?</p>
               <p>O God! O Love! What goodneſs, what flames, where hath ſuch a prodigy and miracle of Love been ever ſeen? A God takes upon him the form of a ſinner, repreſented by this Serpent, and was pleaſed by his death, to cure thoſe who have been the torturers and perſecutors of his life.</p>
               <p>Alas! my poor heart, Art thou not one of thoſe who have murmured againſt God? Have not theſe languiſhments and vexations, which thou canſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal

               <p>O my Jeſus! O my Saviour!

               <p>TO make a relation of the laſt Actions performed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> I muſt imitate Geographers and Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who contract upon their Canvas ſtrokes and lines, to form an Epitomy of the Heavens, Elements, and the greateſt Bodies in nature; nevertheleſs, I could not undertake ſo hard a task, if the deſign thereof had not been marked out, even by his hand, of whom I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſpeak.

               <p>The Pencil then of <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt finiſh this Picture; and there is no perſon, I believe, who may not know that his hand and pen have followed the tracts of his
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:157758:200"/>Spirit, and that there was but one <hi>Moſes,</hi> who could worthily deſcribe and publiſh the commands of God, whoſe inſtincts he ſo juſtly followed, as to ſee and hear him, it was apparent that God animated his ſentiments, who ſpoke by his mouth, who wrought by his hands, and who became, as it were, the ſoul of his ſoul, ſo intimately was he united to him, and all his actions.</p>
               <p>This appeared during the whole courſe of this great Patriarcks life, but chiefly near his end, and namely, when he ſaw himſelf even upon the point of leaving this beloved people, of whom he had been the Prince, Father,

               <pb n="387" facs="tcp:157758:200"/>
               <p>Beſides, it was convenient that <hi>Moſes</hi> who ſaw his end approaching, ſhould declare all his deſires unto his beloved people; and that for his laſt farewel, he ſhould leave them theſe ſpeaking Reliques and Divine Commandments, which ought to ſerve them as dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtique maſters, for the well-ordering both of their lives and manners.</p>
               <p>We may ſay, upon the ſame occaſion,
<note place="margin">An excellent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </note> That <hi>Deute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronomy</hi> is, as it were, but a continual Preaching, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of all the Sentences and Exhortations are animated with Zeal, Ardor, and Piety, as the moſt powerful Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives <hi>Moſes</hi> uſeth to inculcate to all his Auditors, ſuch important Verities and Laws, as on them all their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and ſalvation depend. It is alſo moſt certain, That we our ſelves ought to be touched by the darts of Virtue, and by the ſhaffs of a Holy Love, if we will warm others, and elevate their hearts and ſouls unto God: For otherwiſe, this were to inkindle a fire with water and ice, and to believe, that a pile might be fired by an extinguiſhed Torch. No, no, we ought to be interiorly furniſhed with qualities fit to be imparted unto others, and before we lay ſome touches of a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil upon a Cloath, and ſome ſtrokes of a Graver upon a Plate of Braſs, it is firſt neceſſary to form a rough draught in our mindes; otherwiſe, we ſhall but ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and a multitude of venturous ſtrokes can never finiſh a regulated work: Whence it follows,
<note place="margin">Advice unto publick perſons.</note> that Judges, Maſters, and all that ſpeak in publick, and are as it were, the Living Laws of this World, the Oracles of the People, and the Ecchoes of Gods Will, ought to be like animated Books which onely ſpeak, command, and teach what they have imprinted within themſelves; or rather like Marble, on which it is neceſſary before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, and with much labor, to engrave what is to be there read. In fine, they ought at leaſt to imitate the Sun, which hath always eminently, both heat, beauty, and all thoſe Lights, which without truce and repoſe,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:157758:201"/>he ſpreads upon the Earth. Above all, ſuch as God hath choſen for ſuch important employments ought to ſpeak more from the heart than mouth, and never to ſay during life, but what they ſhould confirm at the hour of death, to the end when they ſhall ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at the point of death, they may have no trouble to retract the errors of their youth, but only repeat the verities they have alwayes gloried to practice and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh in all places.

Then about the end of the ſame Chapter, he commanded the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to chuſe a King of their own Nation, and deſcribed the Qualities which were requiſit for this Dignity.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, He ordains by his order, that the Prieſts and Levites ſhould have onely the Victims, Offerings, and Tenths, for their ſhare in <hi>Canaan.</hi> Afterwards, he made a Publick Act, prohibiting any Conſultation with Diviners and Sorcerers, and promiſed them a Prophet, who ſhould declare to them all the Commands of God.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>Moſes</hi> enjoyned that three Towns ſhould be deſigned for Refuge, and which might ſerve as a Sanctuary for thoſe who ſhould by miſhap kill a man againſt their will; that if it were done voluntarily, the Author thereof was to be baniſhed, and drawn from theſe Towns, firſt to be put into the hands of his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, and afterward puniſhed with exemplary death. As for falſe witneſſes, whoſe tongues are as much or more to be feared, than the hand of a murtherer, they were all condemned unto that kinde of puniſhment, which chaſticeth proportionably to the crime, and demands in rigor, life for life, and ſuch a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as punctually ſuites with the offence of the criminal.</p>

               <p>But alas we know not what will be the iſſue of all theſe happy accidents, and of theſe admirable prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies: for the Aſpects of this amiable <hi>Intelligence,</hi> which have been as it were our ſtarrs, amidſt ſo many obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, and theſe arms which have been ſo often lifted up towards Heaven for our ſafety, after they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted and delivered us amidſt ſo many dangers, are now even ready, me-thinks, to languiſh and decay.</p>
               <p>In truth, the Judgements of God are frightfull A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſſes, and it were to loſe our ſelves, to enter into them with other lights, than thoſe of Faith and Love: All our faireſt deſigns are ſometimes, but the draughts and Images of a dream, where our proudeſt hopes meet on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a Tomb.</p>
               <p>Have we not ſeen Conquerours, who having mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd by their Triumphs the richeſt parts of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, baniſh'd into ſome corner of the Earth; and into the Gates of ſome Cities, where they ſcarce found any Sepulchre?

Behold them in lamentations, in bloud, and under ſome Cypreſs tree, which formeth the funeſtous Crown of their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and the Tomb of their memory. Is this the fatall end of their deſires, the ſubject of their tears, and the period of their projects? At leaſt if their Children were their heirs, and if theſe dolefull iſſues could open them a paſſage, and give them ſome entrance into the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires of honour and immortality, after which they had ſo long ſighed, they would receive this conſolation, that their death had been the life of others, and that in dying, they had rendred themſelves immortall.</p>

               <p>There are no Ciphers but theſe, which neither time, nor eternity can efface, and though a thouſand of them ſhould be written and engraven on Marble and Braſs, with the rayes of the Sun, and with Iron, and Diamantine Gravers, yet they will either ſoon or late loſe their luſtre.

Never ſhall we be ſurpriſed having this Paſport, and if the Holy Land of this World by miſhap be forbidden us, all the Gates of <hi>Sion</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which is in Heaven, will be opened for us.</p>
               <p>O Heaven! O Earth of the living!

               <p>Courage then Chriſtians, <hi>All is ſweet to him, who loves, and to ſerve is ſufficient to gain a Crown.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it is God alone whom we muſt love, and in ſo ſweet and delicious a Bondage we ought to live and die.</p>

               <p>
